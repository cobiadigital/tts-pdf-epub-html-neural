<p>Article
</p>
<p>At the age of 8, I was diagnosed with attention deficit disor-
der (ADD), a “learning disability” which, in conjunction 
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is 
said to presently afflict over 11% of the U.S. population 
(Visser et al., 2014). At the time of my diagnosis in the mid-
1980s, however, ADD diagnoses were much less common. 
With symptoms said to include irritability, unpredictability 
and impulsivity, disorganization, and forgetfulness, ADD 
became both a curse and a blessing for my suburban mid-
dle-class family (Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 2005).1 As a curse, my 
diagnosis corroborated feedback from teachers and family 
friends that my “lack of motivation” and “lack of self-con-
trol” were genetically inherited traits that were not going to 
disappear any time soon.2 Yet, as a blessing, my diagnosis 
enabled my parents to treat my behavioral patterns as signs 
of a biochemical imbalance, enabling my early “deficits” to 
be understood as objects of institutional, interpersonal, and 
pharmacological intervention. Through the identification of 
ADD as a learning disability that could be managed with 
proper medical and behavioral techniques, my unique dis-
position could now be accounted for in relation to a mal-
leable network of ideals, norms, and targets, offering my 
parents hope that I could become “high functioning” within 
their increasingly anxious and high-stakes middle-class cul-
ture. This was a culture guided by dreams of entryway into 
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) during elementary 
and secondary education and, ultimately, acceptance into a 
</p>
<p>prestigious institution of higher education upon the comple-
tion of high school.
</p>
<p>Today, as an associate professor at what some might 
consider a “prestigious” private university, it appears my 
parents’ wishes have come true. While lovingly referred 
to by them as “the absent-minded professor,” I imagine 
that, to the public, I appear relatively productive, and rel-
ative to what people who knew me as a child would have 
expected I must appear immensely productive. When 
interacting with me today, no one knows that at age 10, I 
repeated fourth grade or that from seventh to eighth grade 
I attended Thorton Academy, a private school dedicated 
to “bright children who learned differently”. No one 
knows that when I returned to public school at the start of 
ninth grade I was expelled after only one semester, or that 
for the remainder of high school I was “home-schooled” 
in conjunction with an institution that taught me very lit-
tle. Nor do they know that from age 8 to 13 I was regu-
larly placed on stimulant medications, or that in graduate 
school I returned to them as a way of coping with lifelong

<p>Subjects of Technology: An Auto-
Archeology of Attention Deficit  
Disorder in Neoliberal Time(s)
</p>
<p>Joshua S. Hanan1
</p>
<p>Abstract
This essay (re)presents my own experiences living with attention deficit disorder (ADD) as a child and adult to provide a 
radically historical, contextual, and critical autoethnographic conceptualization of this “learning disability.” Specifically, by 
building upon Ragan Fox’s “auto-archeological” method, a critical perspective that “unite[s] autoethnography and Foucault’s 
theories of discourse,” I draw upon institutional artifacts, psychiatric diagnoses, and interviews with close family members 
to show that ADD is a “technology of the self” that economizes the body in accordance with a distinctly neoliberal 
temporality. This temporalizing process, I show, is reinforced by a range of other neoliberal technologies of selfhood and 
ultimately cultivates the very “deficit framework” that ADD diagnoses are aimed at healing. The conclusion questions the 
legitimacy of ADD outside of the various technological interfaces that make the disability visible as a public problem and 
considers the intimate connections between neoliberalism, ableism, and the contemporary university.

</p>
<p>feelings of being undereducated, underresourced, and 
undervalued.
</p>
<p>No one knows all of this, yet it is important that they do. 
As an “invisible disability,” ADD carries with it lifelong 
psychic and social ramifications, affecting the very capaci-
ties for individual expression and identity formation (Blum, 
2015). As the number of ADD diagnoses increase, and ADD 
becomes an increasingly acceptable, even banal, cultural 
form, it is important to think critically about this learning 
difference and to pose difficult questions: Why, for exam-
ple, has ADD only recently become such a pervasive cul-
tural phenomenon? Whose desires do ADD diagnoses 
actually express, and whose desires are excluded? How 
much “choice” and “free-will” does an individual have in 
accepting or rejecting an ADD diagnosis? What would peo-
ple’s lives be like had they never been so diagnosed?
</p>
<p>As one attempt at engaging with these questions, this 
essay (re)presents my own experiences living with ADD as 
a child and adult to support a radically historical, contex-
tual, and critical autoethnographic conceptualization of this 
learning disability (see Madison, 2011). Specifically, by 
building upon Ragan Fox’s (2010) “auto-archeological” 
method, a critical perspective that “unite[s] autoethnogra-
phy and Foucault’s theories of discourse” (p. 140), my aim 
is to show how one way of conceptualizing ADD is as a 
“technology of the self” that aims at inculcating the every-
day “folk sensibility” of neoliberalism (see Mirowski, 2013, 
p. 89; see also Brown, 2015; Foucault, 2010). As a “politi-
cal rationality” that has become increasingly widespread 
since the late 1970s, neoliberalism is a paradigm of govern-
ment that promotes market-based solutions to all social, 
political, and economic problems.3 From international trade 
agreements emphasizing borderless trade to social policies 
emphasizing the privatization of prisons, social security, 
and public education, neoliberalism believes that no state or 
sovereign entity can solve the world’s problems as effi-
ciently and effectively as the “free market.” Yet the effects 
of neoliberalism are felt not only at the social scale of the 
state and civil society but also at the precognitive and pre-
personal scale of affect and the body. Indeed, as Maurizio 
Lazzarato (2012), Brian Massumi (2014), and Martjin 
Konings (2015) all argue, a defining feature of neoliberal-
ism is its tendency to invest desire with power in ways that 
are unconscious, intuitive, embodied, and prior to the 
socializing effects of disciplinary institutions (e.g., schools, 
prisons, factories, hospitals, barracks, etc.). My conceptual-
ization of ADD as a technology of the self is, thus, an 
attempt to emphasize the material substrate between neolib-
eralism and the everyday performance of subjectivity. As a 
“governing apparatus” that guided my incommunicable 
childhood desires toward the calculative ends of productiv-
ity and efficiency, I will show how, for me, ADD helped 
inculcate a neoliberal social imaginary from the bottom up, 
encouraging me to freely choose a market-oriented 
</p>
<p>subjectivity through the modulation of my body’s affect 
(Chaput, 2010; Greene, 1998; Swenson, 2013).
</p>
<p>To communicate this narrative about ADD, I have orga-
nized what follows into three sections. In the first section, 
I discuss in more detail my methodological perspective, 
which builds upon Ragan Fox’s “auto-archeological” 
method and makes a theoretical case for reading disciplin-
ary power, technologies of the self, affect, temporality, and 
ADD, as nodal points intersecting a more pervasive and 
diffuse neoliberal political rationality. The two remaining 
sections (re)present periods in my life when the role of 
ADD in disciplining my sense of selfhood felt particularly 
prominent: my involuntary introduction to ADD, which 
began in preschool and culminated with my enrollment at 
Thornton Academy in seventh grade, and my voluntary 
identification with ADD during college and graduate 
school. When (re)presenting the former period, I stay true 
to Fox’s auto-archeological method by combining autoeth-
nography with diagnostic material produced by my psy-
chiatrists and interviews I conducted with my parents, 
Seymour and Regina Hanan.4 I regard these “sovereign” 
institutional and parental voices as central to my own early 
account of ADD given how young I was at the age of my 
diagnosis and the role they played in my own “discovery” 
of ADD. When focusing on the latter period, I reflect criti-
cally on the stimulant medications I took and self-help 
books I utilized as a graduate student to gain traction over 
“my disability.” In this primarily autoethnographic section, 
I show how the diagnosis that led me to feel separated from 
my bodily rhythmicity as a child later became a freely cho-
sen “technology of the self” for grappling with the eco-
nomic pressures that characterize the contemporary 
neoliberal university. I conclude by discussing the impor-
tance of neoliberal technologies to materializing ADD as a 
public problem as well as the intimate connections between 
neoliberalism, ableism, and the contemporary university.
</p>
<p>Auto-Archeology Meets Technologies 
of the Self
</p>
<p>Ragan Fox’s (2010) “Tales of a Fighting Bobcat” is a pow-
erful example of how the power analytics of Michel 
Foucault and autoethnography can be brought into conver-
sation with one another. Reflecting on his experience as a 
gay student at Cy-Fair High School during the early 1990s, 
Fox develops an “auto-archeological” method to demon-
strate how “the school’s discursive structures inhibit and 
promote different identity positions” (p. 124). He is particu-
larly interested in depicting how Cy-Fair disciplines and 
regulates the performance of gay identities. As someone 
who endured repeated acts of ridicule, bullying, and humili-
ation—both inside and outside the classroom walls—Fox 
demonstrates, through tales from his own lived experience, 
how gay bodies are subjected to uneven treatment based on </p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="page"><p></p>
<p>Hanan 107
</p>
<p>their performative deviation from dominant heterosexual 
standards and norms.
</p>
<p>At the theoretical and methodological level, Fox’s auto-
archeological project hinges on a consideration of how spa-
tial arrangement sutures the discursive performance of 
identity and subjectivity. In his account, we learn how the 
architectural design of Cy-Fair—from its hallways to its 
particular configuration of bodies and objects of knowledge 
in the classroom—provide opportunities for some students 
to thrive and other students to suffer violence and dehuman-
ization. At the other end of the spectrum, his consideration 
of Cy-Fair’s physical layout brings attention to what 
Kendall Phillips (2002) terms “spaces of invention.” 
Through a description and diagram that depicts the way 
Cy-Fair restricts the movement of its students, we learn that 
Fox moved in relationship to oblique pathways at school 
both as a means of survival and as a way to express his 
unique lived experiences.
</p>
<p>By combining the power analytics of Foucault, institu-
tional artifacts from Cy-Fair, and autoethnography, Fox’s 
project produces invaluable insights. Too often, Foucault is 
interpreted as a systems theorist who emphasizes the top-
down effects of power on the “molding of docile bodies.” In 
Fox’s account, by contrast, we learn about the performative 
and psychic dimensions of disciplinary power. Through Fox’s 
autoethnographic narratives, which position his lived experi-
ences in relationship to the heteronormative spatial arrange-
ment of Cy-Fair, it becomes clear that disciplinary power 
works upon the individual body in a way that is always con-
tingent, material, historical, affective, and discursively unsta-
ble. At the same time, because he conceptualizes discipline as 
a primarily spatial manifestation of power, his auto-archeo-
logical perspective limits our appreciation of the important 
role played by temporality in the performative and psychic 
enactment of disciplinary power. If, as Foucault (1976/2012) 
argues, discipline is a “technology that . . . targets individuals 
right down to their bodies . . . [and] behaviors” (p. 9), then it 
is important to conceptualize this modality of power not only 
in relationship to space and institutional enclosure but also in 
terms of the more immediate, vital, and affective logic of 
temporality and rhythmicity (see Binkley, 2009).
</p>
<p>One way of accomplishing this task, I argue, is to shift 
the focus of auto-archeology away from spatial enclosure 
and toward a different disciplinary problematic that 
Foucault (1988) terms “technologies of the self.” As the 
techniques, processes, and rituals that bodies perform on 
themselves to gain traction on themselves as autonomous, 
self-sufficient, and unique individuals, technologies of the 
self facilitate an auto-archeological consideration of power 
at the affective register of bodily rhythmicity. In contrast to 
a socializing and spatialized conception of power, which 
exercises discipline through institutional prohibitions and 
juridical constraints, bodies performing technologies of the 
self provide a vector for discipline that is immanent to the 
</p>
<p>pulsations, intensities, and affective flows that comprise the 
body prior to its territorialization by symbols and society 
(see Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1980/1987). While technologies 
of the self always materialize in relation to other technolo-
gies—such as those concerning sign systems, economic and 
biological (re)production, and political sovereignty—they 
are unique in the emphasis they place on the body’s own 
unconscious and autopoietic desire(s).
</p>
<p>Technologies of the self is a particularly valuable frame-
work for an auto-archeological perspective that seeks to 
appreciate ADD in the context of neoliberalism. Although 
Foucault’s (1988) classic examples of technologies of the 
self are from the Greco-Roman period and include tech-
niques such the stoic practice of journal writing and the 
Christian confessional, it becomes clear in texts such as 
Discipline and Punish (Foucault, 1975/1977) and the first 
volume of The History of Sexuality (Foucault, 1984/1990) 
that technologies of the self multiply and proliferate in mod-
ern, liberal society. As an architecture of power that coheres 
around the “instrumental rationality” of the capitalist mode 
of production (see Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944/1997; 
Arendt, 1958/1998; Heidegger, 1954/2013; Marcuse, 
1964/2013; Weber, 1905/2013), liberal society requires 
technologies of the self for the management and economiza-
tion of human passions and desires. Through its cultivation 
of a secular environment that affectively disavows the prom-
ise of eternal afterlife, liberal society has traded in practices 
of religious and spiritual asceticism for cultural technologies 
of selfhood that generate surplus-enjoyment out of finite 
time and temporality (Kordela, 2013; Žižek, 1989).
</p>
<p>This technological and temporalizing articulation of 
reality becomes particularly clear in the secular context 
known as neoliberalism. As Foucault argues in the Birth of 
Biopolitics, a key aim of neoliberalism is to produce a sub-
ject that relates to herself as “human capital.” As an affec-
tive gaze, or orientation toward society, that seeks to 
“entrepreneurialize its endeavors, appreciate its value, and 
increase its rating or ranking” (Brown, 2015, p. 36), human 
capital speaks to a capitalist epoch where all aspects of 
human life—from genetics and marriage to education and 
nationality—can be quantified and measured in economic 
terms (Greene, 2004). Whereas the Fordist-Keynesian 
regime of power that preceded neoliberalism required 
“paternal” disciplinary institutions (e.g., the school, the fac-
tory, the hospital, the barracks, etc.) to inculcate the instru-
mental rationality of capitalism, neoliberalism is able to 
bypass this logic through the everyday circulation of tech-
nologies of the self that (almost) instantaneously temporal-
ize affect and bodily rhythmicity. From the cell phones we 
carry (with fertility planning apps such as Choice and navi-
gational apps such as Google Maps—both ultimately aim-
ing to increase the efficiency and predictability of cyclical 
movement via the standardization and economization of 
time) to the social media websites we visit (which </p>

</p>
<p>use algorithms to order, sort, and profit from our hobbies, 
interests, and passions) to the self-help books we read (to 
“make the most” out of our finite time on earth), we reside 
in a condition where myriad technologies of the self freely 
circulate with the aim of producing an economizing subject 
(homo œconomicus) “whose interest is such that it con-
verges spontaneously with the interest of others” (Foucault, 
2010, p. 270).
</p>
<p>Based on my lived experiences, ADD is a powerful 
example of how this new technological articulation of self-
hood can manifest. Despite appearing discursively as a 
“learning disability,” I conceptualize ADD, from an auto-
archeological perspective, as a neoliberal technique of 
power that disciplines the body through the management 
and modulation of affect. As an example of what Mitchell 
Dean (1996) has termed a “reverse salient,” I show how my 
ADD diagnosis served to inculcate a larger neoliberal social 
imaginary from the bottom up by allowing me to economi-
cally order and structure aspects of my subjectivity that 
deviated from economic order and structure. Through the 
affective and mnemotechnical introduction of a “deficit” 
that became “the focus of [my] attention and innovation” 
(Dean, 1996, p. 57), ADD worked in tandem with a range of 
other neoliberal technologies of selfhood (e.g., familial nar-
ratives, psychiatric evaluations, stimulant medications, self-
help books, etc.) to generate a freely chosen market 
subjectivity.

It hurts looking back on all this documentation.
</p>
<p>Seeing my childhood as wrought with malignancy.
Why don’t I remember all this evil?
</p>
<p>All of this negativity that has haunted my psychic life.
It sits with me now like a puzzle.
</p>
<p>Myriad narrations yet none my own.
Why am I so removed from these experiences?
</p>
<p>All I feel now is a certain form of theft and robbery.
</p>
<p>Who Is Joshua Hanan?
</p>
<p>I was born in Grand Junction, Colorado, to two of the most 
loving parents: Gina and Seymour. Gina, a 4′11″ kindergar-
ten teacher, with short, sandy blonde hair, a petite frame, 
and a small ski-sloped nose, had waited her whole life to 
have a child. Just like her own mother, Gina’s life revolved 
around the distinctly American and middle-class dreams of 
her progeny: the vision that her children would achieve 
more (economic and social) recognition in their lives than 
she herself had achieved. So, after reading countless books 
</p>
<p>on “effective” parenting, talking to other mothers and 
friends about their experiences raising children, and, of 
course, teaching kindergarten for the past several years, 
Gina felt prepared for her “biblical prodigy,” Joshua.
</p>
<p>Seymour, on the contrary, a 5′6″, petite-framed man with 
a Mediterranean complexion, mustache, and short, curly 
hair, had a different take on childhood. Still a child himself 
in many ways, Seymour knew that having a family meant 
he would finally have to be settled. Seymour was a very 
loving father, a quality evidenced by his wonderful 15-year-
old daughter, Jennifer, from a previous marriage. 
Nonetheless, when informed of my mother’s pregnancy, 
Seymour notoriously asked, “how did that happen!” (S. 
Hanan, Personal interview, October 3, 2005).
</p>
<p>Things were relatively stable during the first few years 
of my life, and when I was three, my family and I moved to 
Bellevue, Washington, so that my father could take a job at 
Boeing. Yet, as my mom notes in one of our first interviews 
on the topic of ADD, there was something different about 
me from the start:
</p>
<p>I had always felt like you were a little anxious as a child . . . I 
remember showing up one day 20 minutes late to pick you up 
from Montessori school, and you were crying hysterically. 
This, of course, was not a one-time incident; you often worried 
about your family. Still though, it wasn’t until we moved to San 
Diego that things became complicated. (G. Hanan, Personal 
interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>On Things Becoming Complicated
In preschool Joshua was identified by his teacher as being 
somewhat hyperactive and having limited attention. 
(Learning Difference Center, 1991, emphasis added)
</p>
<p>He had few friends . . . little interest in workbooks, and was 
noted to be toe walking. (Wiseman, 1990)
</p>
<p>We moved to San Diego in 1987, and you started kindergarten 
at Jerabek; you also went to the preschool next door, which 
was run by that lady Jan Atley. She had a lot of trouble with 
you. She was sending me notes all the time telling me how you 
were disruptive . . . She said there was a time after class when 
they had circle time, and you were constantly bothering other 
kids. . . . I always thought I could talk with you . . . [but] Jan 
Atley said what you needed was a good spanking. (G. Hanan, 
Personal interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>There is little I recall of preschool even though I’ve been 
driving by that old Victorian building for over 30 years now. 
Naturally, Dr. Wiseman and my mother know much more 
about my experience there than I do. Letting them speak for 
me, therefore, is in a sense speaking for myself. All I have 
to ground these early childhood experiences are fragmen-
tary narratives from my family and behavioral diagnoses </p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="page"><p></p>
<p>Hanan 109
</p>
<p>from my psychiatrists that, in a sense, have become my own 
contested identity. I do not like what Dr. Wiseman says 
about me, particularly the connections she draw between 
my “toe-walking,” hyperactivity, and lack of popularity. Yet 
my sense of selfhood is entangled with her narratives, and 
the decisions my family made to “develop a plan of attack” 
that could “help Josh function better” (Learning Difference 
Center, 1991).
</p>
<p>An Introduction to Discipline: Kindergarten
In kindergarten work was sloppy. . . and [he] continued to 
be very distractible. (Wiseman, 1990)
</p>
<p>Now in kindergarten class your teacher didn’t have a big 
problem with you. But she felt you read slow. I said to her I 
thought you were very bright and maybe even gifted. But she 
said oh no, if he was gifted he wouldn’t be reading so slow. (G. 
Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>Ms. Evergreen, the kindergarten teacher. Another name 
etched into what has come to feel like an increasingly plastic 
and amorphous identity. I sense the classroom faintly; the 
smell of crayons and a dark stale ambience. Yet, like Dr. 
Wiseman, I approach Ms. Evergreen from a detached dis-
tance. Who I was at this time in my life seems guided more 
by the regimes of selfhood that my family and I were “pre-
scribed” by these various authority figures than any “authen-
tic” inner voice laying hidden behind a secret curtain. As I 
listen to this narrative, it, in a sense, becomes part of my lived 
experience. How can a kindergartner have an identity any-
way? Are these narratives not the very “folding of the exte-
rior” that generated my ADD identity? (Deleuze, 1988, p. 97)
</p>
<p>The Pill Pusher: First Grade
Day care [sic] tantrums, school call-outs, and concentration 
problems continued in first grade, resulting in consultation 
with Dr. Zoro. (Wiseman, 1990)
</p>
<p>At Miramar Ranch Elementary [which you transferred to in the 
first grade]. . . you actually did pretty well. But you were still 
having a little difficulty. . . focusing so we took you to get a 
diagnosis for Attention Deficit Disorder [which] is right 
around when . . . [the] disorder was kind of coming in vogue. 
We saw a psychiatrist named Dr. Zoro, and he had us do a 
history on you . . . I told him how there was depression on my 
mothers’ side . . . and he thought maybe you had some mild 
depression [as well]. He suggested that you take [the anti-
depressant] Imipramine. And we figured we’d try it. So you 
took Imipramine in first grade, and it was kind of a mixed bag. 
We weren’t really sure of the results. It seemed like a hit or 
miss. (G. Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>Dr. Zoro—now this is where I start to feel some imme-
diacy. I can remember what he looked like, too, his thin 
</p>
<p>black beard, penetrating eyes, and angelic white medical 
garb. I remember sitting in his office cubicle, taking one 
diagnostic test after another. He would show me pictures 
with parts of the image missing and ask me to arrange the 
images in a particular order that told a story about myself. I 
remember how he spoke to me with incredulity and what felt 
like a layer of disrespect. Through his “medical gaze,” I 
recall feeling like a prisoner, some disobedient criminal who 
needed to correct and reform his ways (Foucault, 1963/1994). 
Well fuck you, Dr. Zoro, and your sterile pills, too!
</p>
<p>Citizen of the Month: Second Grade
This year there have been increasing concerns regarding 
poor peer relations, insensitivity and selfishness, lack of 
motivation, and progressive aggression and lack of self-
control. (Wiseman, 1990)
</p>
<p>So then came second grade and you started out on the 
Imipramine, but . . . it seemed like you were having a hard time 
focusing again. And you were doing some really weird things 
like irritating other kids, making weird noises, and doing all 
sorts of other crazy things at school. So I wasn’t sure if the 
Imipramine was making things better or worse at this point. So 
we went and saw another psychiatrist named Dr. Wiseman in 
second grade and she suggested you try a different kind of 
medicine. She said maybe you should try Dexedrine . . . a 
stimulant. Then, we also had you tested by the resource 
specialist and she found something that might have contributed 
to your strange anti-social outbursts . . . she determined you 
had a really big deficiency between your verbal ability and 
your performance ability. . . . So . . . she worked with you 
[also]. (G. Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>October 3, 2005
</p>
<p>As I stand here in front of the closed orange door of Room 
221, peering at the entryway of what I believe was my sec-
ond grade classroom, memories flood my mind. Mrs. 
Winters, with her short, curly, orange hair, seemed so kind 
to me. She always complimented me and made me feel spe-
cial. She even gave me a “citizen of the month” award at the 
end of the year, a modern sacrament of recognition that my 
mom had been waiting for her entire life. Yet, I suspect 
these very acts that made me feel “special” actually rein-
forced my feelings of detachment from my early educa-
tional experience. Between the resource specialist, the foul 
tasting Dexedrine that I’d leave the classroom to take 
throughout the day, the physical exercises Dr. Wiseman rou-
tinely asked me to perform, and the overly kind words of 
Mrs. Winters, I could feel, in my sinews, that primary edu-
cation was a space where I did not belong. How I long to 
repeat this grade over again, and show my mother, Mrs. 
Winters, and Dr. Wiseman that I can succeed without the 
medications, mechanical techniques, and strategies that 
were hoisted upon me.</p>

<p>Becoming Goofy: Third Grade
Currently, Joshua is perceived as a bright child with 
excellent reasoning and verbal skills, with difficulties with 
impulsivity, inattention, and unpredictability of moods. He 
has no friends, fights constantly with his [younger] sister, 
and when angered, slams the door, becomes verbally 
abusive and [throws] tantrums. He tests discipline and 
responds to it with manipulation or tantrums. (Wiseman, 
1990)
</p>
<p>Then we get to third grade and you had Ms. Stanley as your 
teacher, and again you were doing pretty well academically, 
but you were displaying kind of goofy behavior and you were 
kind of turning the other kids off . . . . And at this point the kids 
were getting meaner, and they were starting to notice that you 
were acting a little strange and they were picking on you. You 
were still on Dexedrine. So we weren’t sure if it was making 
matters better or worse. Then you had fine motor tests done, 
and they determined that you had a hard time writing. (G. 
Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>I’m getting to the point now where I feel a little move-
ment and autonomy coming back. The amnesia is slowly 
eroding. But all these “crazy,” “strange,” and “manipula-
tive” behaviors that Dr. Wiseman and my mom talk about 
feel like a puzzle to me. I was just being “me,” right? I do 
recall some of the outbursts I made such as “bazumbah” and 
“willie watcha.” I think I just enjoyed getting attention from 
my funny antics and had a lot of energy I wanted to express. 
And truth be told, I just didn’t feel like keeping my mouth 
shut. I mean, in all honesty, why should I? To this day, I 
have never felt like the classroom should be a place of 
restriction and discipline. I always wanted its doors to be 
open to “noise” rather than just communication (see Ballif, 
1998).
</p>
<p>Repetition and Absence: Fourth Grade, Two 
Times
</p>
<p>Then, in fourth grade we thought we’d put you in a private 
school because we thought you’d get more specialized 
attention. So you went to the Jewish Academy. Yet instead of 
making the situation better, it actually made it worse . . . A lot 
of the students there didn’t like you. You were irritating them, 
and they wanted to do really good work . . . So then we put you 
in this place called the Accelerator Academy for the next six 
months, and they didn’t believe in any kind of medication. So I 
believe you were off medication at this time. But it still was not 
working very well. You were still acting weird. You had 
outbursts and didn’t want to cooperate with them. So they 
would constantly try to manipulate your behavior, and it 
wouldn’t work. So by the end of the year, you were asked to 
leave. Then when you went back to Miramar Ranch [the 
following year], Ms. White [the principal] said we should put 
you in a fourth grade GATE class. She wasn’t sure how much 
school you missed, so you repeated the grade. And you actually 
</p>
<p>did really well in that class . . . I think you were back on 
Dexedrine again at that point. (G. Hanan, Personal interview, 
September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>As Dr. Wiseman’s medical narrative wanes and sub-
sides, my own story comes into focus a bit more. I recall 
the fourth grade quite vividly. I remember the Jewish 
Academy, where I was attacked and bullied regularly. I 
recall being labeled a “moron” and an “ass” simply 
because I asked “weird” questions when most of my peers 
sat silently and consumed the teacher’s information. I still 
have a scar on my arm from Randy, that jerk at the Jewish 
Academy who pushed me onto the concrete for being a 
“whiner” and a “girly.”
</p>
<p>Oh and then there was the Accelerator Academy. What a 
nightmare! I remember the day I was expelled:
</p>
<p>“Joshua, please read your Worldly Wise passage out loud for 
the class.”
</p>
<p>I don’t want to, I’m tired of reading. I don’t understand the 
story. Why doesn’t Eric get to go to the zoo?
</p>
<p>“Joshua, I don’t even want to deal with you today! Get out of 
my class, and go back to the Principal’s office where you 
belong.”
</p>
<p>[Jumping under the table and hiding] NOOO! I won’t go there 
again. You send me there all the time. [Crying.] I hate that 
place! All they have me do there is lick envelopes that they use 
for marketing purposes! Just leave me alone. . . .
</p>
<p>The Secret Is Out: Fifth Grade
In fifth grade, I believe you continued to be on Dexedrine. You 
were in Mr. Kipling’s class, and I don’t think it was as good of 
a year for you because the kids were becoming cliquish. And 
they were making fun of you because you were acting goofy. I 
don’t think they liked you very much. (G. Hanan, Personal 
interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>You don’t think they liked me very much? You can say 
that again. I still remember the tension in that grade like it 
was yesterday. I got into my first fight that year and also 
went completely unnoticed by my first childhood crush. 
This was the first time I think I really wanted to fit in; to 
feel the frictionless travel and movement around the 
school that my fellow classmates seemed to be experienc-
ing (Fox, 2010). Yet I remember feeling very rejected and 
marginalized. God it was painful. And that FUCKING 
medication, which I can still faintly taste in the back of my 
throat. I would leave class every day at 1 p.m. so I could 
go down to the nurse’s office and take my second dose of 
stimulants. It felt like everyone knew what was going on; 
that they all knew I was the “ADD child.”</p>

<p>The Last Straw: Sixth Grade
Then, sixth grade was a disaster. That’s when you went to 
Eastside [Middle School] and again you were acting really 
goofy, and the kids once again didn’t like you. And if you’re 
asking me what I mean by goofy, I’m not sure what that means, 
but you weren’t a very serious, focused student. You would 
make outbursts, and the kids didn’t really like you. So by the 
end of the semester, I filed a grievance with the school district 
because I didn’t feel like your needs were being met. And, I won 
the grievance, and then you went to Thornton for two years. 
(G. Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005)
</p>
<p>Looking back, sixth grade truly does seem like one of the 
most negative years in my life. I still remember Gregory 
calling me a “faggot” in the locker-room and whipping me 
with a towel. I also remember being physically assaulted on 
the playground by Melissa, one of the most attractive and 
popular girls in my class. I wonder whether things could 
have been different. It is hard to say whether all the therapy, 
pills, and special treatment I received from my teachers 
made my experience better or worse. As my dad notes about 
my sixth grade teacher:
</p>
<p>And then there’s that stupid thing that lady [teacher] said when 
you were in sixth grade. She tells the whole class you have to 
be sensitive to Joshua. . .he has ADD, and you have to realize 
he’s a misfit or something like that. She didn’t use that word, 
but that’s what she implied by that. You had this thing where 
you didn’t fit into this category. And most of the kids didn’t like 
you . . . I really felt like you were rejected by a lot of friends and 
family growing up. (S. Hanan, Personal interview, October 3, 
2005)
</p>
<p>A Natural Attraction: ADD Meets the 
Discipline of Rhetoric
</p>
<p>As I reflect upon the narratives surrounding my childhood 
diagnosis of ADD, it is difficult to make sense out of the 
experience. Certainly, there are emotions that linger with 
me up to the present. But what is most startling to me, as I 
revisit the voices of my mother and father, as well as the 
various psychiatric documents used to (over)determine my 
ADD diagnosis, is the absence of my own voice. I vividly 
remember as a child moving through various institutional 
spaces—from classroom, to the psychiatrist’s office, to 
family dinner table—but what sticks out most is a certain 
temporality, an affective pulsation of fear, unease, and 
uncertainty that something was not right with me. I recall a 
desire to resist, to reject the regimes of selfhood that felt 
foisted upon my body. But I also recall, over time, settling 
into my ADD diagnosis—not necessarily as a way to 
“improve” or “correct” my behavior, but as a way of con-
cluding that the normal pathways of society were not for 
me. As teenager, for example, I found identification through 
non-normative activities. I became a vegan, anarchist 
</p>
<p>“crust” punk and involved myself with unconventional 
activist groups such a Food Not Bombs and Earth First!. 
Rather than try to become accepted by the “popular” 
crowds, who had continually rejected me since kindergar-
ten, I came to embrace cultures and experiences that stood 
on the fringes of society.
</p>
<p>What stands out as particularly troubling and difficult to 
reconcile in the present, however, is the stark contrast 
between how I reacted to my ADD diagnosis as an adoles-
cent, and how I came to freely embrace the “learning dis-
ability” as an adult. What felt like an incomprehensible 
punishment and imposition that I sought to resist as a child 
and teenager became, in my adult years, a vehicle for self-
empowerment and self-expression. This shift in perspective 
seems particularly vivid around the time I transitioned to 
college. Unlike elementary school, which disciplined my 
body for thinking and acting against the norm, college felt 
open to a variety of cognitive dispositions and world-
views. In fact, in some of my humanities classes, thinking 
critically and participating in activism seemed to even be 
encouraged.
</p>
<p>Nowhere did this sentiment become clearer than during 
my third undergraduate year at Humboldt State University. 
I was enrolled in a required major class called “Introduction 
to Rhetorical Theory,” and I was expecting to have minimal 
interest in the topic. Yet, after only a few class sessions, I 
became intrigued by the subject matter. Part of this enthusi-
asm, I can still recall, stemmed from the way “the subject of 
rhetoric” aligned with my subjectivity as an ADD-diagnosed 
child and teen. Rhetoric gave me the vocabulary to think 
critically about my early encounters with my diagnosis, 
turning this ostensibly genetic “neurochemical imbalance” 
into a technē of power, persuasion, and coercion. Whatever 
the particular details of the alignment were, by the semes-
ter’s end I knew I wanted to further study and ultimately 
teach rhetoric. The “weird,” “goofy,” “crazy,” and “strange” 
child who “didn’t fit into a category” now had a queer and 
disabled language of his own called “rhetorical theory” (see 
Dolmage, 2016).
</p>
<p>By the time I began working on my master’s degree in 
rhetoric at San Diego State University, however, I quickly 
learned that a life dedicated to the study of persuasion and 
power was not immune from its own institutionalized mani-
festations of power and persuasion. In addition to instilling 
in me an insecurity that my troubled educational experience 
as a child and teenager put me at an intellectual disadvan-
tage relative to my peers (who, at least on the surface, 
seemed to have chosen an academic career partly because 
of their previously successful educational experiences), 
pursuing a Master of Arts in Communication Studies taught 
me that, to secure a job as a professional rhetorician, I 
would have to publish my ideas in “peer-reviewed” jour-
nals. As a technology aimed at the production and dissemi-
nation of “expert” knowledge, publishing in journals felt </p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="page"><p></p>
<p>112 Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies 19(2) 
</p>
<p>terrifying to me given that they appeared, in many ways, as 
concerned with “measurement” and “assessment” as the 
diagnostic tests I was forced to take as a child—both at 
school and in the psychiatrist’s office.5
</p>
<p>My anxieties around academia became even further 
intensified when I began working on my Doctorate in 
Rhetoric and Language Studies at the University of Texas. I 
had a passion for studying rhetoric, that much was certain, 
but, as one professor said to me over Facebook (in an act 
that reminded of the institutionally sanctioned elitism and 
bullying that I endured during middle school), my “cards 
were stacked really low.” Hence, in what can only be 
described as a painful and ironic twist, it was upon working 
through cruel affects of failure and insecurity during my 
Doctorate program in rhetoric that I decided to get re-diag-
nosed with ADD. Realizing that, without a network of self-
help resources, I would be vulnerable to the “market 
discipline” of securing a tenure-track job, I began volun-
tarily meeting with a psychiatrist and seeking out ways I 
could become a more “productive” and “efficient” graduate 
student. I was confirmed during my first psychiatric visit as 
having “Adult ADD” and was immediately prescribed 
Adderall, a stimulant medication similar to the Dexedrine I 
had previously taken as a child. Initially, the drug provided 
a powerful boost to my focus and productivity. Whereas my 
childhood experimentations with similar medications are 
clouded by memories of peer judgment, a bitter taste in my 
throat, a racing heart, and the inability to fall asleep at night, 
during graduate school, I felt the Adderall was an “edge” 
that could help me economically compensate for my lack of 
education as a child and teenager. As a medication (molecu-
larly similar to cocaine and methamphetamine) that pro-
duced feelings of concentration and euphoria, Adderall 
acted as a pharmacological “technology of the self” that 
buttressed and supported the “technology of the self” that 
was ADD. Through its capacity to help me bypass the usual 
feelings of fear, dread, and doubt surrounding academia, 
Adderall not only assisted me in working more efficiently 
but for longer and more prolonged periods of time. Who 
needed rest, relaxation, or even sleep when I could take 
Adderall and work like a well-neurochemically-lubricated-
machine all the time!
</p>
<p>My enthusiasm for Adderall, however, soon waned. 
Whereas initially, a 10-mg dose supplied clarity, confi-
dence, and focus throughout the day, my tolerance increased 
exponentially after several months. A 10-mg dose was now 
required simply to sustain my previous “base-level.” I also 
found myself increasingly detached from social surround-
ings as I became interested exclusively in work and produc-
tivity. With the neurochemical bathing in dopamine that the 
Adderall provided, my world materialized through a lens of 
cost-benefit analysis. Any deviation from graduate studies 
and the pursuit of publications was a waste of valuable time, 
and if I did take time off to go to a concert or go on a date, 
</p>
<p>they needed to provide the biggest possible “bang for my 
buck.” Under the influence of Adderall, my sense of tempo-
rality radically shifted. I transitioned from someone who 
valued a range of work and non-work activities into some-
one who valued productivity and efficiency “around the 
clock.”
</p>
<p>Realizing that this legally endorsed activity seemed 
unhealthy for my long-term psyche and mental health, I 
read books on ADD to learn about the pros and cons of 
long-term stimulant use. Most of the books were propo-
nents of medication use, and virtually all of the books com-
municated that long-term usage of Adderall was “safe” and 
“normal.” Consider the following endorsement of stimulant 
medication found in one the first books on ADD that I read 
as an adult:
</p>
<p>From a medical standpoint taking [stimulant medication for 
ADD]. . .is not a difficult decision. Stimulant medications, the 
main group of medications we prescribe to treat ADD, are as 
safe as penicillin or aspirin when they are used properly. First 
used in 1937, they have been around for more than 60 years, so 
we have extensive research data on them and decades of 
clinical experience. (Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 2005, p. 241)
</p>
<p>Safe, so they say, but in what sense? While it is one thing 
to be safe from the impartial standpoint of a “medical 
gaze” (Foucault, 1963/1994, p. 9), it is quite another to be 
safe in a way that respects the “singular rhythms” of my 
body (Muckelbauer, 2009, p. 33). While I cannot speak 
for others, in my experience, taking stimulants as an adult 
was anything but “safe.” Although it reinforced a view 
popular since Francis Bacon’s day (i.e., that science can 
be used as a form of power to extract excess energy and 
value from nature and the body), stimulant medications 
left me feeling physically and emotionally depleted. At 
the time, however, I was unable to value the voice of my 
body over the voice of experts. Thus, when it came time 
to either quit Adderall or request an increased dosage, I 
chose the latter.
</p>
<p>In addition to reinforcing my decision to remain on stim-
ulants, in spite of the increasingly toxic affect that they cul-
tivated, these popular books on ADD provided me with 
“self-help” strategies to assist me in being a more success-
ful graduate student. While some strategies were indeed 
helpful, I found that, as with the medications, they also led 
me to feel increasingly robotic, mechanical, and economiz-
ing. These self-help strategies essentially indicated that if I 
wanted to make my “life go smoother and easier . . . [I 
needed to] identify a problem, something that makes our 
lives more difficult and less productive, . . .[and] come up 
with a strategy to help” (Puryear, 2012, p. 15). The irony 
was that in identifying these “problems” aimed at making 
my “life go smoother and easier,” I had created an economy 
for aspects of my life that were formerly off-limits to </p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="page"><p></p>
<p>Hanan 113
</p>
<p>market discipline. Thus, if taking Adderall was not enough 
motivation to work like a machine “day in and day out,” the 
self-help strategies ensured that any remaining “downtime” 
would best be used in “preparation” for success during my 
marathon working days. The temporality that, as a child, led 
me to despise authority figures and want to avoid the class-
room at all costs was now infusing my body with a new 
internalized (and paternalizing) authority figure who sought 
to formulate “everything, everywhere, in terms of capital 
investment and appreciation” (Brown, 2015, p. 176).
</p>
<p>As shameful as it feels to admit, and as difficult as it is to 
commit these words to paper, I maintained this masochistic 
regimen for the remainder of graduate school, throughout 
my 2-year appointment as a non-tenure-track assistant pro-
fessor at Temple University, and well into my current ten-
ure-track position at the University of Denver. Eventually, 
as the ups and downs of Adderall-fueled-workaholism took 
an increasing toll on my physical and mental health, I con-
cluded that I must give up my investment in being a rhetoric 
professor in order continue professing rhetoric. Since my 
first “introduction to rhetorical theory,” my desire was to 
teach and research rhetoric no matter what the “cost.” But 
the paradox was that to study “the art of persuasion” I had 
unconsciously persuaded myself that productivity was all 
that mattered.
</p>
<p>For over 4 years now, I have been free of Adderall and, 
interestingly, feel more in touch with my voice as a rhetoric 
scholar than at any time during my ADD regimen. I still 
likely work far more than I should. And I still subtly crave 
the feelings of focus and euphoria that initially came with 
taking Adderall. But I know I can never go back. I know 
now that neither the institutional sanction the drug enjoys 
nor the psychiatric voices that spectrally haunt my own ado-
lescence and adulthood know what is best for me and my 
body’s singular rhythms.
</p>
<p>Conclusion: On Neoliberal 
Detachment
</p>
<p>This essay has explored my involuntary and voluntary iden-
tification with ADD as child and adult. Using a revised ver-
sion of Ragan Fox’s auto-archeological method, I have 
shown that one way to conceptualize ADD is as a technol-
ogy of the self that aims at inculcating the everyday folk 
sensibilities of neoliberalism. Through a consideration of 
how my own affect and bodily rhythmicity fueled my early 
and late diagnoses with ADD, I have shown that the disci-
plinary power exercised by this “learning disability” can be 
conceptualized less in terms of spatial enclosure and more 
in terms of the everyday imperative to economize time. 
While institutional enclosure (such as the psychiatric and 
educational spaces that I moved through as a child and 
adult) undoubtedly played an important role in my encoun-
ter with ADD, what seems exceptional about the diagnosis 
</p>
<p>was the way it took on a life of its own by wounding, and 
then economizing, my body’s unconscious and prepersonal 
affects and desires (Brown, 1993).
</p>
<p>As a consequence of these insights, I draw two conclu-
sions. First, there is the distinct possibility that “learning 
disabilities,” such as ADD and ADHD, are co-constituted 
by the matrix of practical reasoning that makes the disabil-
ity “measurable” as a public problem (Greene, 1998, p. 31). 
While I do not presume to speak for others struggling with 
ADD and ADHD—many of whom I’m sure benefit signifi-
cantly from diagnosis and medication—this essay shows 
that, in the case of my own lived experiences, AD(H)D is 
entangled with a neoliberal social imaginary that governs 
bodies through the vital management of affective energies 
(Chaput, 2010; Swenson, 2013). Whereas previous mani-
festations of capitalism required paternal disciplinary insti-
tutions to inculcate the instrumental rationality of capitalism 
(a reality first illustrated by Marx [1867/1990] more than 
150 years ago), neoliberalism is a political rationality that 
seeks to immanently harness the energy, dynamism, and 
vitality of life itself (Foucault, 2010, 1976/2012; Rose, 
2009). As my own narrative about ADD shows, the affec-
tive imperative to economize life was an encounter that 
began prior to my entryway into preschool and organically 
evolved into a technology of selfhood that lives on in me 
today as an associate professor of rhetoric at the University 
of Denver. In a world where the “invisible” pressures and 
forces of the self-regulating market have become the quint-
essential expression of discipline, AD(H)D diagnoses strike 
me as an ideal way to produce imminently governable neo-
liberal subjects who perceive themselves to be autonomous 
from any particular historical context or apparatus of power.
</p>
<p>The second conclusion to be drawn relates to the often-
overlooked relationship between neoliberalism, ableism, 
and the critical humanities. If my localized experience is at 
all indicative of how other academics with learning differ-
ences feel, the critical humanities have failed in creating an 
inclusive academic space for what Silberman (2015) calls 
“non-neurotypical” bodies. While the performances of gen-
der, sexuality, class, and race are rightfully receiving 
increased attention in the critical humanities (see, for exam-
ple, Calafell, 2012), we should be equally reflexive about 
the implicit and explicit ways these disciplines perform 
ableism (Dolmage, 2017). Writing for and getting articles 
published in academic journals is not a feat that comes with 
equal ease to everyone, and yet, in today’s neoliberal acad-
emy, it has never been more central to “measuring” one’s 
academic size, virility, and prowess (Gunn, 2008, pp. 
85-86). This economizing of critical humanistic scholarship 
is not only symbolic (and regularly exploited as a form of 
“cultural capital”) but also material. As an integral compo-
nent of neoliberalism, the critical humanities participate in 
the competitive ordering and sorting of scarce resources 
(Chaput, 2008; Harney &amp; Moten, 2013). They determine </p>

<p>who earns “secure” tenure-track positions and who remain 
laboring precariously as instructors and adjuncts. They 
decide who shall tell their stories and who shall not. They 
inadvertently encourage some of us to consume stimulant 
medications, and others to simply break down, in the never 
ending pursuit of “doing what we love” (Tokumitsu, 2014).
</p>
<p>The critical humanities needs to be more reflexive about 
their perpetuation of ableism as well as their participation in 
neoliberalism’s political economy of knowledge. Neoliberalism 
is not an ideological superstructure that scholars can transcend 
through the cultivation of reason and a thriving public sphere. 
Nor is it a cold and austere market logic they can comfortably 
critique from the sidelines. Neoliberalism is warm to the touch. 
It is embodied through the air that we all breathe. It is an every-
day folk sensibility that must be combated at an equally affec-
tive, corporeal, and immanent level if we are to resist its 
poison.

<p>Notes
</p>
<p>1. Studies show that people from lower socioeconomic back-
grounds have higher rates of attention deficit disorder (ADD); 
yet ADD is often framed as a “middle class” problem. It is a 
situation deserving of further attention and a subject I hope to 
explore in subsequent essays. See Nauert (2010).
</p>
<p>2. Quotations are taken from diagnostic proceedings used to 
diagnose me at a young age with ADD. The document states 
these evaluations were prompted “because of the mother’s 
desire for a ‘plan of attack’ to help Josh function better” 
(Learning Difference Center, 1991, emphasis added).
</p>
<p>3. The concepts of “political rationalities” and “rationalities of 
government” are central in Foucault’s later writings on “gov-
ernmentality.” These concepts emphasize the role of power 
in materializing an abstract “grid of intelligibility” that regu-
lates human and non-human life at various institutional and 
technological scales. For a concise discussion of political 
rationalities, see Brown (2015) and Lemke (2015).
</p>
<p>4. My interviews were conducted during the fall semester of 
2005 while working on my Master of Arts at San Diego State 
University. Excerpts from interviews with my parents are 
unmodified from their original versions. Only the names of 
the teachers, psychiatrists, and locations have been altered.
</p>
<p>5. This reality is attested to by the difficulty I have had pub-
lishing this essay. I began working on this project 14 years 
ago as a graduate student in Patricia Geist-Martin’s ethnog-
raphy seminar. After rejections from multiple journals, I 
finally received a conditional accept from Cultural Studies 
↔ Critical Methodologies (CSCM). I appreciate CSCM’s 
</p>
<p>willingness to let me speak in my own voice and its refrain 
from the disciplinary gatekeeping that I have encountered as 
a critical theorist and rhetorician seeking to voice my experi-
ences through a foreign methodological lens.
