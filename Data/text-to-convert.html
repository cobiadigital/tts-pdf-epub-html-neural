3 </p><p>Philosophy and Theories </p><p>of Learning Applicable to Coaching and Mentoring Positive Psychology and the Learning Process </p><p>Introduction </p><p>This chapter describes the philosophy and theories of psychology that are applicable to coaching and mentoring. Positive psychology is identified as the philosophy that underpins coaching and mentoring. numerous learning theories that are relevant to coaching and mentoring are reviewed. First, the chapter will introduce the philosophy of positive psychology as a foundation for coaching. it will then give an overall discussion based on the general review of literature on the psychology of learning. Finally, some of the more generic learning theories are singled out for further development. These will form a building block in our development of a dynamic coaching and mentoring model and of a universal framework that is applicable across cultures. </p><p>Positive Psychology </p><p>Following his introduction to the 2000 edition of the American Psychologist, Martin Seligman (with his colleague Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi) published 16 articles on the topic of positive psychology (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). The themes broached in these articles ranged from questions such as what enables happiness, what are the effects of autonomy and self-regulation, how optimism and hope affect health, or what constitutes wisdom to expositions on how talent and creativity come to fru- ition. For example, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1991) introduced the concept of flow to describe the optimal experience: the fact that people could improve the quality of their life by focusing on improving their experiences. This conscious attempt could be applied to all areas of one’s life: work, everyday experience or the search for meaning. The authors outlined a framework for a science of positive psychology. They had an optimistic view that this paradigm shift would enable us to understand and build the factors that allow individuals, communities, and societies to flourish in this new century. </p><p>The Psychology of Coaching, Mentoring and Learning, Second Edition.

Bringing together theory, research and practice from disparate fields, it offers the possibility of an integrated and well-founded approach to enhancing the quality of working life and organizational effectiveness’ (quoted from the PowerPoint presentation at the workshop). </p><p>From our review of modern literature in psychology, which is not limited to learning theories, we have noticed that positive psychology is directly relevant to coaching and mentoring. Positive psychology is also concerned with the improve- ment of performance and well-being (Linley and Harrington, 2006). it shares a similar paradigm shift from a pathology-orientated understanding to a perspective of growth and positive development. The shift is exemplified by Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman’s (2004) presentation of their book Character Strengths and Virtues as a ‘Manual of the Sanities’, in direct contrast to the 1994 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders sponsored by the American Psychological Association. </p><p>So we see positive psychology providing us with a possible foundation to improve quality of life, as well as coaching and mentoring practice. if this discipline were applied in the clinical setting, it would offer a promise to prevent illnesses and the sense of hopelessness and meaninglessness – and it would do it in a different way from how it’s done in classic psychotherapy and clinical psychology. More specifically, the european psychotherapeutic approach has been criticized as ‘culturally blind’, non- universal, and biased in its over-emphasis on the pathological model (Law, 2004a, 2004b). As a result of this approach, we live inherently in a culture that lacks positive features such as aspirations, wisdom, creativity, future-mindedness, courage, spiritu- ality, responsibility, perseverance, hopes and dreams that make our lives meaningful and worth living. </p><p>Although positive psychology has been perceived as a new movement in modern psychology, its linage can be traced back throughout european psychology to Maslow (1968), Rogers (1963), Allport (1961), Jahoda (1958), Jung (1933), and as far back as James in 1902 (James, 1960); see Linley and Joseph (2004a, 2004b). Philosophically and culturally, it has a resonance in the Platonic and Aristotelian tradition, which is shared by all Western philosophies. </p><p>There are three ‘pillars’ of positive psychology in relation to the concept of a more positive and fulfilling life: </p><p>1 positive emotion – the pleasant life; </p><p>2 positive character – the engaged life; </p><p>3 positive institutions – the meaningful life. </p><p>A positive emotion such as happiness can be classified within three domains: </p><p>1 the past (satisfaction, contentment, fulfilment, pride and serenity); </p><p>2 the present (joy, ecstasy, calm, zest, ebullience, pleasure and flow); </p><p>3 the future (optimism, hope, faith, trust). </p><p> </p><p>Coaching (and mentoring) can be understood from the perspective of positive psychology (Kauffman and Scoular, 2004; Linley, 2004). Positive psychology covers enquires into human conditions such as happiness, wisdom, creativity, and human strengths. it has considerable potential for benefit – and this benefit extends to coach- ing, so in this section we provide a detailed account of their area of overlap. </p><p>Sponsored by the Values in Action institute, Peterson and Seligman (2004) conducted some research by means of a survey designed to measure human strengths. They found 24 ‘signature strengths’, which were clustered into six dimensions: </p><p>1 wisdom and knowledge (creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective): cognitive strengths that consist of knowledge acquisition and its application; </p><p>2 courage (bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality): emotional strengths that involve the exercise of the will to accomplish goals in the face of challenges, dangers, difficulties, fears, obstacles, pains or threats; </p><p>3 humanity (love, kindness, social intelligence): interpersonal strengths that involve ‘tending’ and ‘befriending’ others; </p><p>4 justice (citizenship, fairness, leadership): civic strengths that underlie a healthy community life; </p><p>5 temperance (forgiveness and mercy, humility and modesty, prudence, self- regulation): strengths that protect against excess; </p><p>6 transcendence (appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humour, spir- ituality): strengths that forge connections to the larger universe and provide meaning. </p><p>The 24 elements of strengths (with their sub-elements in the bracket) are as follows: </p><p>1 Creativity (originality, ingenuity): produce adaptive and original ideas or behaviour that have a positive contribution to your life or others’. Think of novel and produc- tive ways of doing things. This strength covers artistic achievement but is not limited to it. We extend it to contributions to the organization, community and society. </p><p>2 Curiosity (interest, novelty seeking, openness to experience): explore and pursue nov- elty, variety and challenge; seek experience for its own sake (for its intrinsic interest). </p><p>3 open-mindedness (judgement, critical thinking): search for evidence against your favoured belief, plans, goals, and weigh such evidence fairly when it is avail- able. Think the situations through and examine them from all sides, without jumping to conclusions. </p><p>4 Love of learning: be positively motivated to acquire new skills and knowledge or to enhance existing skills and knowledge. This also associates with the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe one’s tendency to learn systematically and improve what one already knows. </p><p>5 Perspective (wisdom): take a long-term view on the basis of your knowledge and experience. Provide wise counsel to others; look at the world that makes sense to yourself and to other people. </p><p>6 Bravery (valour): do what needs to be done voluntarily, despite fear in a dangerous situation. Speak up for what is right even if there is opposition; act on convictions even if they are unpopular. </p><p> </p><p>7 Persistence: finish a task despite obstacles and take pleasure in completing it. ‘Get it out the door.’ </p><p>8 integrity (authenticity, honesty): tell the truth and present yourself genuinely, but take responsibility for your feeling and act without pretence. </p><p>9 Vitality (zest, enthusiasm, vigour, energy): feel alive, have enthusiasm in what you do, even in difficult circumstances. Approach life with excitement and energy. Live life as an adventure. </p><p>10 Love: reciprocate, develop and value emotional relationships with family mem- bers, friends, colleagues, coachees and mentees. </p><p>11 Kindness (generosity, nurture, care, compassion, altruistic love, niceness): be compassionate, helpful, nice to others. do favours and good deeds for others; help them; take care of them. </p><p>12 Social intelligence (emotional intelligence, personal intelligence): be aware of the emotion of other people and of your own. Process emotion (so-called ‘hot information’). Know what to do to fit into different social situations, and what makes other people tick. See Chapter 6 for more discussion about this element within our universal integrated framework. </p><p>13 Citizenship (social responsibility, loyalty, teamwork): identify with a common goal that is above your personal interests and includes the group of which you are a member. do your share and work well as a member of a group or team. Be loyal to the group. </p><p>14 Fairness: treat all people equally and without bias. Give everyone a fair chance. </p><p>15 Leadership: inspire group members to do what they are supposed to do, and at the same time keep a good relationship and high morale: this is the so-called </p><p>transformational leadership (Tichy and devanna, 1986). </p><p>16 Forgiveness and mercy: let bygones be bygones instead of being negative. </p><p>Forgive those who have done wrong. Give people a second chance instead of </p><p>being vengeful. </p><p>17 Humility and modesty: let your accomplishments speak for themselves. </p><p>Acknowledge your mistakes and imperfections. </p><p>18 Prudence: consider carefully the consequences of your actions in order to </p><p>achieve long-term goals effectively. </p><p>19 Self-regulation (self-control): exercise control over your emotions and responses </p><p>in order to achieve a desirable outcome. </p><p>20 Appreciation of beauty and excellence (awe, wonder, elevation, transcendence): </p><p>appreciate and enjoy the experience of beautiful things such as art, music, foods </p><p>and drinks and so on. </p><p>21 Gratitude: have a sense of thankfulness in response to gifts. Be aware of and </p><p>thankful for the good things that happen. Take time to express thanks. </p><p>22 Hope (optimism, future-mindedness, future orientation): think about and work towards future outcomes positively. expect the best in the future and work to </p><p>achieve it. Believe that a good future is something that can be brought about. </p><p>23 Humour (playfulness): laugh and tease; bring smiles to the faces of others skil- </p><p>fully. See the light side. Make (not necessarily tell) jokes. </p><p>24 Spirituality (religiousness, faith, purpose): have a coherent belief about the </p><p>higher purpose and meaning of the universe and one’s place in it. Have beliefs about the meaning of life that shape conduct and provide comfort. </p><p> </p><p>By examining the common characteristics of the elements of strength (thematic analysis), Peterson and Seligman (2004) set up ten criteria for inclusion. The items listed above satisfied most of them. The ten criteria are: </p><p>1 being fulfilling for individuals (for the self and others); </p><p>2 being morally valued in its own right; </p><p>3 not diminishing others when displaying a strength; </p><p>4 having a non-felicitous opposite; </p><p>5 being trait-like; </p><p>6 having distinctiveness; </p><p>7 being a paragon; </p><p>8 being expressed by prodigies; </p><p>9 contrasting with the strengths of others (those who do not have such a strength); </p><p>10 being nurtured by institutions and rituals. </p><p>The optimism of positive psychology represents an attitudinal shift in psychology from its focus on individuals as asocial to individuals as socially, culturally and ethically responsible beings. Positive psychologists regard this as a fundamental cornerstone for meeting the challenge for change in our multicultural societies and in the face of globalization. For more recent developments in the research and applications of positive psychology, see for instance Hefferon and Boniwell (2011). </p><p>Linking Learning to Coaching and Mentoring </p><p>Many coaches and mentors argue that coaching and mentoring would function as a powerful lever to promote leaning and change. in this book we argue that, while coaching and mentoring offer such an opportunity for learning, this outcome could not be guaranteed as a ‘given’. For learning to take place, coach and coachees, men- tors and mentees must actively engage in the learning process during the coaching and mentoring journey. So this epistemological position provides a starting point in asking more questions: </p><p>•  What is the ‘right condition’ for learning? What condition could lead to an ‘Ah ha!’ experience? </p><p>•  How do coaching and mentoring sessions provide the condition for learning? </p><p>•  What factors does this condition consist of – for example, what assumptions, </p><p>beliefs, ideas and values – and how do we establish them? </p><p>Coaching and mentoring as a learning process </p><p>Coachees and mentees as well as coaches and mentors are all learners. We thus regard coaching and mentoring as learning processes. While the learning condition includes both physical and social aspects, there are likely to be many barriers in the process of learning. Most of these barriers are psychological (the so-called ‘inner game’: see Gallwey, 2000). These inner barriers may have developed from individuals’ negative experiences in the past. Many people had negative experiences with learning, and this </p><p> </p><p>may prevent them from learning further, new materials. This in turn forms a negative feedback loop, which hinders future learning. on the other hand, positive learning experiences can help coachees to develop their capacity for further learning. This in turn forms a positive feedback loop. For example, participants in coaching programmes were asked to list: </p><p>1 the negative experiences they have had in the past, which may stand in the way of change; </p><p>2 the attributes of a poor coach; </p><p>3 the attributes of a good coach. </p><p>in response, many of the participants responded with memories of their own teachers and lecturers. </p><p>From all this we learn that the essence of learning, be it in teaching, training, coaching or a mentoring context, seems to be universal. To learn, one must embrace (internalize) a new set of values, attitudes, skills or knowledge that one did not have before (for child developmental learning, see Kegan, 1982, 1994). in this context, the learner’s task is to internalize the socio-cultural-temporal surround of the new situation (Jarvis, 1987). </p><p>The coach’s task is to help learners bring to their awareness what was internalized in the past. The process is known as mapping the landscape of action on the landscape of consciousness, in a narrative approach (see Chapter 7 for techniques and tools). </p><p>Clients tend to focus on learning that connects to the context of their workplace, in particular in executive coaching. it is therefore helpful to provide a number of case studies that may help readers to identify their own context. </p><p>The Psychology of Learning </p><p>Historically, the study of learning was divided according to two ways of thinking – epistemological and experimental: </p><p>1 epistemology questions the nature of what we know, asking what knowledge is and how we distinguish it from our own internal thoughts and beliefs. </p><p>2 experimental approaches derive theories by conducting scientific experiments. </p><p>There are three kinds of learning theories within the epistemological tradition. These are: </p><p>1 Objectivism Reality is external and independent from the learner. Knowledge is acquired through sensory experience. </p><p>2 Pragmatism Reality is both external and internal. Although reality exists, it is pro- visional, as it cannot be known directly. Knowledge is interpreted through signs and negotiated from experience and reason. </p><p>3 Interpretivism Reality is internal, relative to individuals’ frames of reference. Knowledge is constructed by the learner through thinking. </p><p> </p><p>experimental approaches have generated four major learning theories: </p><p>1 The principle of association one learns ideas by direct association. This was demonstrated in 1885 by ebbinghaus (1850–1909) through the famous verbal learning experiments of nonsense syllables, which produced the classic forgetting curve (ebbinghaus, 1913). ebbinghaus argued that meaning did not influence learning and that the prior knowledge we store in our memory has no effect on what we continue to learn. </p><p>2 The law of effect one learns by associating sensation/impulse to action (proposed by Thorndike, 1874–1949). </p><p>3 Classical conditioning one naturally generates a response (unconditioned response) to a stimulus (unconditioned stimulus). An example would be the secretion of saliva when food is presented. The same response can be produced by pairing the unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus. over time, the neutral stimulus alone can elicit the same response. The stimulus and response are now called conditioned stimulus and conditioned response respectively (this theory was advanced by Pavlov, 1949–1946). </p><p>4 Gestalt theory originated from the perception of motion from flashing light (the phi phenomenon). Gestalt psychologists propose that knowledge acquisition requires the learner to actively impose organization (gestalt) on sensory data in order to derive insight (insightful learning). </p><p>According to gestalt theory of insightful learning, there are five stages of learning: </p><p>1 The learner goes through a period of trial and error. </p><p>2 The learner completely grasps the solution. This seems to occur suddenly </p><p>(an ‘Ah ha!’ moment). </p><p>3 The learner produces a smooth error-free performance. </p><p>4 The knowledge is long-lasting. </p><p>5 The learner can apply the same principle to solve a similar problem in a new </p><p>context. </p><p>Psychological research has indicated that there is a lot we can do to optimize our chances of achieving effective outcomes when we act as learners, having exchanges in purposeful relationships designed to bring about new knowledge and skills. Self- determination, autonomy, participation and choice underpin many studies about learning participation (Spreitzer, 1995). Social learning theories, and particularly the reinforcement affect model, continue to influence our understanding of learning in collaborative settings (Clore and Byrne, 1974). in short, this model assumes that we like anyone who or anything that makes us feel good and dislike anything that or anyone who makes us feel bad. Rewards in relationships can include attention or being attended to, praise and positive interaction. As learners, we will do better when we are in a receptive environment where we feel attended to and supported. in a different kind of setting the transferability of these theories is limited. Self determination, autonomy and choice are often, in certain cultures, preferred values for a range of behaviour, and the interpretation of positive inter- action may vary from setting to setting. For example, autonomy might be very </p><p> </p><p>valued in one company but be considered averse to teamwork in another, which prefers compliance with a procedural framework. </p><p>Another commonly cited element in learning success in developmental relation- ships is goal setting for learners (Locke, Shaw, Saari and Latham, 1981). Goal setting has been a Western preoccupation and may not be automatically meaningful across all cultures and situations. even in studies in europe, where coaches have been asked to work in coaching relationships without clear goal boundaries, coaching participants have evidenced no negative outcomes as a result (Law, ireland and Hussain, 2005). increasingly over the years, practitioners have started to talk more about emergent learning, unstructured learning, informal learning and the idea that all this may be more exploratory and less rigidly goal-restrained than was previously thought. </p><p>Likewise, our fixation with linking evaluation to development has meant that we have used traditional goal-based structures to facilitate evaluation processes, which have gained credibility through the hard core of scientific data from research. new developments, in particular the wider acceptance of looser structures for evaluation in social science, such as appreciative enquiry, have liberated us from some of those con- straints. Appreciative enquiry is more able to address relative and individualized progress within the context of operation rather than progress against preset targets. </p><p>on the basis of the principles of positive psychology described earlier, we can iden- tify what we are already able to do but need to do more of. We can also identify areas where our capabilities are weak and where we need to update our skills and knowledge. We can check our motivation to achieve our goals and our levels of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1982). </p><p>The self-efficacy concept comes from social cognitive theory. it is a belief in one’s own capacities to achieve a given goal (Bandura, 1997). Self-efficacy also links expectation to action/behaviour and outcome. There are three possible types of outcome that one could expect (Bandura, 1986, 1997): </p><p>1 physical effect as a consequence of one’s direct action (e.g. pain or pleasure); </p><p>2 social effect (e.g. approval, recognition etc); </p><p>3 self-evaluative effect (reflective). </p><p>While outcome expectancies refer to the perception of the possible consequences of one’s action, self-efficacy expectancy refers to personal action, control or agency. A person who believes in being able to produce a desired effect can conduct a more active and self-determined life course. This ‘can do’ thinking represents a sense of control over the environment. it reflects the belief that you can control challenging environmental demands by means of taking adaptive action. individuals with high self-efficacy choose to perform more challenging tasks, anticipate optimistic scenarios and are active in identifying knowledge and skill sets that can help them overcome barriers and achieve their learning goals. According to Bandura (1977, 1982, 1997) there are four ways to influence one’s self-efficacy: </p><p>1 by providing feedback on learners’ own capabilities (enactive mastery experiences); </p><p>2 by providing comparative information about the attainments of others (vicarious experiences); </p><p> </p><p>3 by telling learners what others believe them capable of achieving (verbal persuasion); </p><p>4 by letting learners judge their own ability to engage in the task at hand (physiological </p><p>states). </p><p>Four conditions for continuous motivation and self-regulation (known as the ARCS </p><p>model of motivational design) are proposed by Keller (1984). These conditions are: </p><p>•  to gain and sustain attention; </p><p>•  to enhance relevance; </p><p>•  to build confidence; </p><p>•  to generate satisfaction. </p><p>To summarize, to design a coaching and mentoring process may involve the fol- lowing steps: </p><p>1 analysing the coachees and mentees; </p><p>2 defining motivational objectives; </p><p>3 designing a motivational strategy; </p><p>4 implementing the plan of action; </p><p>5 evaluating and reviewing. </p><p>There are numerous motivation theories that can be applied to the study of the motivation of learners. Maslow (1954, 1968) put forward a model of hierarchical needs. People are motivated to satisfy their psychological, safety, belonging, self- esteem and self-actualization needs. These needs represented conditions that learning partners might seek to establish in order to maximize learning outcomes. Psychology has traditionally recognized the power and role of beliefs in shaping reality. Theories have been put forward with belief systems in the mix, or where beliefs alone are central to understanding behaviour. Merton (1948), in line with the latter tradition, introduced the concept of self-fulfilling prophecy, to refer to a false belief that leads to its own fulfilment. Such beliefs are associated with under-achievement, social stereotyping and discriminatory behaviour. in learning situations, individuals with low expectations and beliefs about themselves – which are perhaps the result of what others have communicated to them (e.g. ‘you won’t do well’) – tend to deliver according to expectation, so they don’t perform well. When negative and limiting expectations are extended to the stereotyping of groups, under-achievement might follow. </p><p>This individualized self-fulfilling prophecy approach has been criticized, because recent studies show that the impact of self-fulfilling prophecy is low and other factors are more significant in determining behaviour and outcomes. The self-fulfilling prophecy has been used to explain the under-achievement of minority groups. it conveniently places the problem of under-achievement in the lap of the minorities themselves. it suggests that there is a real deficit in their belief systems, which results in their under-achievement and indirectly limits their successful engagement in processes that would help them be successful. extensions to an inter-group perspective recognize that the false beliefs may be communicated and maintained by the majority culture. However, there is less financial sponsorship dedicated to re-aligning the beliefs </p><p> </p><p>of majority cultures. Secondly, individual minority success (which defies predictions using this model) is rarely celebrated in ways that are likely to shift majority opinion. Vroom (1964) has been credited with creating the expectancy valence theory, where there needs to be positive correlations between efforts and performance, favourable performance results and desirable rewards. Rewards satisfy important needs, and the desire to satisfy the need is strong enough to make the effort worth while. This approach has been criticized for a lack of inclusion of normalized and rou- </p><p>tine behaviour, which is particularly embedded in cultures. </p><p>Many Western psychological concepts are seen as the absolute ‘truth’, when in fact </p><p>they are limited in their scope when it comes to describing and predicting behaviour across the diverse communities in which people engage in learning. Learning goes beyond concepts of individual difference, and particularly beyond our modern fasci- nation with self-management. Learning might stem more from the interplay between the individual learner and the environment in which he or she operates. </p><p>even the nurture–nature debate appears in a different light in a world of diversity, where science and technology are interacting before we are born, determining the core of our being. For example, genetic research and the standardization of aspects of nur- ture such as the core educational curriculum wrap around care and national standards to ensure the homogenization of nurture in institutional settings. Conceptually, the whole debate is limited by the primary assumption that nature and nurture are elements that are completely separate from each other and can be judged in terms of the independent and distinctive influence of each on the subject learner. But there are many counter-assumptions that we are indistinguishable from our environment and that nature and nurture are entwined in such a fundamental way that no valid measurement could be used to isolate the contribution of one independently from the contribution of the other. Secondly, this debate has often failed to recognize that we are changed by our environment while we are also an agent of its change, and that learning comes from the experience of the interplay between these two sides of the coin. </p><p>The context of operation and an appreciation of the other players are key to our learning success. At times the context in which we operate has fixed elements, which may limit our learning goals or the methods we employ, and at other times it is something we can shape entirely. However, this context is rarely as fixed as we pre- sume, and the learning starts by ensuring that we are able to accurately construe our environment, to define the culture and its players and to be clear about what is fixed and what is fluid. </p><p>naturally, the environment is ever changing, and we are also always changing adap- tively, in light of our emerging learning and insights. We need therefore to integrate our own learning into new goals (if applicable), at the same time as keeping up with the contextual and cultural changes that affect our relationships and purpose. </p><p>our perception of fixed elements and fluid elements in the culture of operation is also impacted by such things as the perceived locus of control (Rotter 1956). in the locus of control model (which is part of social learning theory), there is a general expectation that one’s behaviour is or is not directly related to the outcome. depending on their perceptions, individuals attribute the source of the power to change particular life events to internal factors, to external factors or to chance. Hence one person might see more elements in his or her environment as fixed beyond his or her control than another. Such impressions may impact on our learning strategies and styles. </p><p> </p><p>Locus of control theory is also problematic in terms of how it explains cross-cultural differences. Control tends to be a Western higher order priority, which is not always transferred globally. destiny and fatalism, reticence, putting others’ needs before one’s own, and reflection may have a lower value than a ‘think can do quickly’ approach endorsed in Western contexts. </p><p>Learning Theories Revisited </p><p>This section combines the pragmatic and interpretive approaches described in the earlier section and aims to re-examine the key learning theories within this tradition, both past and present, which inform coaching and mentoring practice. From the literature review, a whole family of theories emerge that are relevant in this context (e.g. Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger and Tarule, 1986; Loevinger and Blasi, 1976; Perry, 1970; Kegan, 1982, 1994; Kolb, 1984; Mezirow, 1991, 2000; Freire, 1992; Lave and Wenger, 1991; and Wenger 1998). These include: </p><p>•  the learning process; </p><p>•  reflective learning; </p><p>•  constructive–developmental theories; </p><p>•  social learning theories. </p><p>The learning process </p><p>Learning, like coaching, is a process that has a beginning, a middle, and an end (and we can use journey as a metaphor here too). it is like a wheel (Figure 3.1), as in Kolb’s (1984) learning cycle, except that some of the positions of the elements have been changed in relation to coaching and mentoring. As a starting point, </p><p>  Reflection </p><p>Abstract conception </p><p>Internal transformation: consciousness emerges </p><p>External transformation: towards behaviour </p><p>Concrete experience </p><p>Action </p><p> Figure 3.1 </p><p>The learning wheel (modified from Kolb’s (1984) learning cycle) </p><p> </p><p>learning is grounded in a concrete experience when learners and coach interact (the point of social engagement). </p><p>our learning wheel consists of four stages of learning: </p><p>1 concrete experience; 2 reflection; </p><p>3 abstract conception; 4 action. </p><p>Concrete experience For learning to take place, first the learners need to experience an event. This provides the individuals with a starting point in understanding how they experience the situation and handle any problems or challenges in relation to the world. </p><p>Reflection The value of reflective practice has been well recognized as a framework for our professional learning and development in coaching and psychology (for example, for coaching in sport psychology, see Anderson, Knowles and Gilbourne, 2004). After experiencing the event, learners also need to appreciate the nature of their experience and to take time to reflect upon it (Merriam, 1994). it would be desirable to think about the lessons learnt (how and what). This involves comparing the present event with the past experience and thinking about the future possibilities (this is pattern matching within the schema structure). it is also important for learners to reflect on themselves as learners. Learning is ‘a way of being’ (Vaill, 1996). Reflection is viewed by a lot of practitioners in education as an important part of learning. it is also an essential element in leadership development as well as in the development of coaches and mentors, so we shall devote the next section to exploring this stage in greater detail. </p><p>Abstract conception Through reflection, this is a process designed to translate the experience into a meaningful concept. (See the later section on meaning.) </p><p>Action We define the term ‘action’ quite broadly (in contrast to Kolb, who narrowly refers to the end stage of the learning cycle as an active experimentation). Action may include a decision arrived at through reflection and evaluation of an event. Thus action could include an option not to act. </p><p>For the wheel to roll forward in the learning process, two forms of transformation are required: upward and forward. The upward movement reflects an internal transfor- mation from concrete experience to the formation of a new consciousness (abstract conception). The forward movement indicates a behavioural shift from internal reflec- tion to external action. </p><p>Knowledge, resulting from this process, is a combination of grasping the everyday experience and transforming it into an abstract concept. From our experience, we have also found that there are considerable individual differences among coachees and mentees in terms of their strengths and weaknesses in the learning process. Some are good at producing knowledge (thinkers), while others are quick to act (actors). Some enjoy engaging in actual events and learning from experience (sensors), while others prefer to reflect upon their experience (evaluators). The four modes of learning – as </p><p> Table 3.1 Learning styles </p><p>   Internal Transformation </p><p>internal Cognition Thinker external Perception Sensor </p><p>External Transformation </p><p>evaluator Actor </p><p>      sensor, thinker, evaluator, and actor – define an individual’s learning styles (see Table 3.1). </p><p>Moreover, learners who are internally focused on their locus of control are more likely to focus on goal-setting for themselves and on the development of self-efficacy (evaluators and thinkers), whereas externally focused individuals are more likely to be receptive to external feedback and sensitive to the environment around them (actors and sensors). People who attribute causality to chance or fate might be more passive in their engagement with causality. Those who have achieved the mastery of all four learning styles are known as reflective practitioners. Reflective practitioners are able to grasp the concrete experience and transform it into action through reflection and con- ceptualization. in coaching and mentoring (and also in many learning professions such as education and psychology), we aim to develop learners’ competence so that they may become reflective practitioners. As the term suggests, reflection is an impor- tant element in this learning process. We explore this further in the next section. </p><p>Reflective learning </p><p>in its simplest form, learning can be viewed as having the potential to transform. This may be achieved through reflection and action (praxis), whereby a new consciousness emerges (conscientization: Freire, 1992). Through this learning process, individuals become free from their limiting beliefs and arrive at an informed and reflective decision (emancipatory learning: Mezirow, 1996). </p><p>As seen from the previous section, reflection is an important driver for transforma- tion within the learning process according to Kolb’s (1984) learning cycle. For, without reflection, people would not learn from their experience; they would con- tinue to experience the world in which the same emotion and perception occur in a ‘self-confirming loop’ (Brookfield, 1991; Jarvis, 1992). From the above assertions we can clearly conclude that reflection is a cognitive function that may occur even when the individuals are away from the situation where the event has taken place. it may occur from memory, by remembering the experience. We thus define reflection as a cognitive process that involves both thinking and feeling about an experience (past or present): from this thinking and feeling a new consciousness emerges with a new appreciation, understanding and insight about that experience. </p><p>our definition resonantes with the opinions of many other scholars in the field (see Brookfield 1991; Boud, Keogh and Walker, 1985: 19). The definition implies that reflection is a metalevel of information processing where individuals interpret their thinking, learning and understanding, paying attention to their own assumptions, beliefs and values, which might shape their conclusion. Reflection is effectively a form of internal self-assessment, which could be made explicit by disclosing it to others verbally, in a coaching session, or through writing – in the form of an essay, letter or  </p><p>4.

Description: Concrete experience </p><p>        Figure 3.2 Six substages of reflection (combined models from Kolb, 1984, and Gibb, 1988) </p><p>diary (see Chapter 7). Such disclosure, known as a reflective account, is beneficial for both learners and coaches: it helps them to understand their own experience and draw conclusions or a plan of action from it. </p><p>The reflection stage within the learning wheel can further be expanded into a sub- loop with six finer stages, as shown in Figure 3.2 (see, for example, Gibb, 1988): </p><p>1 description: describe what happened during the concrete experience. </p><p>2 Cognition and emotion: reflect on your thoughts and feeling. What were you </p><p>thinking/feeling during the engagement/incident? </p><p>3 Analysis: try to understand what happened and draw meaning from the experi- </p><p>ence. What sense can you make of the experience? </p><p>4 evaluation: assess the pros and cons, benefit and cost of the outcome of the </p><p>experience. </p><p>5 Conclusion: summarize the meaning and the lessons learned; look for improve- </p><p>ment. in the light of what happened, would you have done it differently? What </p><p>else could you have done? </p><p>6 Recommendation/action plan: recommend a future plan of action for further </p><p>learning and improvement. if a similar situation arose again, what would you do? What are you going to do to further improve and develop yourself/performance? </p><p>We have modified Gibb’s six-stage model of reflection, as we felt that analysis is closely linked to the conclusion but should be its prerequisite. As the saying goes, ‘don’t jump to conclusions’ without an analysis and without making sense of the experience. Conclusions should follow logically from the evaluation, with possible recommenda- tions for future action. This framework also fits well within our dynamic coaching/ mentoring/learning model, with meaning as an intervening variable (to be discussed later). </p><p> </p><p>in making a critical reflection of the coaching process itself, coaches and mentors would experience a dialectic tension, in the sense that, on one hand, the experience in coaching and mentoring is usually rich in physical motion and emotion, while on the other a reflective account is always anchored around ‘levels of cognitive engagement’. These levels of cognitive engagement may be aligned with Haberman’s (1971) three levels of cognitive interest, as follows (Gilbourne, 2006): </p><p>1 Technical cognitive interest: relates to a limited form of reflection such as account- ability, effectiveness and efficiency. </p><p>2 Practical cognition: valuates and reviews the consequences of actions and their underlying meaning for practice. </p><p>3 intuition: associates with emancipatory processes and ethics (in this case, with a transpersonal spirit – a spirit that is beyond oneself). </p><p>in practice, the three levels overlap. Level 3 may act as an overarching reflective scaf- folding from which one may choose to climb up or down. The form of self-assessment given above is part of a critical reflection that involves individuals in making authentic, objective judgements about themselves (Boud, 1995; Marienau, 1999). in the pro- cess, learners would gain a greater appreciation of the influence they have on their own learning and future possibilities. Self-development becomes a natural outcome of the reflective process. </p><p>Constructive–developmental theories </p><p>Constructive–developmental theories link developmental growth to meaning construction (Perry, 1970; Loevinger and Blasi, 1976; Belenky et al., 1986; Kegan, 1982, 1994). As the name of the theories suggest, many advocates of this approach link the theory of learning to the child development process (Piaget, 1954; Loevinger and Blasi, 1976; and Kohlberg, 1981). Constructive–developmental theories are essentially cognitive development theories within the paradigm of constructivism. Constructivism assumes that knowledge is constructed from our experience of the world, with many signs and symbols (hypermedia), through a critical discourse. in this section i shall highlight some of the major theories that may be relevant to coach- ing and mentoring. </p><p>Piaget’s theory of child development </p><p>in european counties and generally in the West, Piaget’s proposed stages of child development have been widely applied over the past few decades in the design of the educational curriculum. His views continue to attract the interest of teachers, students and parents. Within the context of coaching and mentoring, Piaget’s theory of stages may have implications for mentoring in school and for parenting of children and young people. These stages of cognitive development are briefly outlined below: </p><p>1 Sensorimotor (from birth to age 2) This stage is linked to the development of sensory perception and the ability to respond via motor reflexes (grasping and sucking during the first eight months are examples of such responses). Gradually children develop an awareness of the world around them; for example, they </p><p> </p><p>become aware of hidden objects (object performance), and they actively explore objects for their own pleasure (for example, they manipulate objects to seek attention, or they imitate the behaviour of others – the role-models; and this includes deferred imitation – that is, imitation that takes place even after the role models have gone). </p><p>2 Preoperational (ages 2–7) Children acquire language and develop an ability for thinking in terms of symbols or symbolic representation (for example ‘X=apple’) and for imagination with mental imagery. At this stage children would only see the world from their own perspective (they are egocentric), and they hold a relatively static view of the world (centration). </p><p>3 Concrete operations (ages 7–12) Children develop an ability for logical reasoning applied to concrete objects and events; they also develop or acquire multiple viewpoints (for example, they realize that the same object may have different appearances – the conservation concept). </p><p>4 Formal operations (ages 12–25) Young people are able to perform abstract reasoning and make hypotheses to predict outcomes. </p><p>one should note that the above stages are somewhat theoretical and abstract. in practice, the boundaries between them are blurred. There are various deviations from this abstract model of developmental stages among children across the world. Social–cultural influences on child development should not be underestimated. For the application of coaching and mentoring in education, see work by Pask and Joy (2007) and van nieuwerburgh (2012). </p><p>in coaching and mentoring we argue that development does not stop in adulthood. Given the right conditions, most adults continue to learn throughout their lives. Theories of adult development would be more applicable to most coaching and mentoring in and outside the workplace. </p><p>Levinson’s life structure theory </p><p>on the basis of results from the interviews of 40 men aged between 35 and 45 and using the metaphor of seasons, Levinson, darrow, Klein, Levinson and McKee (1978) identified the following life stages: </p><p>1 spring (childhood and adolescence: from birth to the age of 16) </p><p>2 summer (early adulthood: 17–40) </p><p>3 autumn (middle adulthood: 41–60) </p><p>4 winter (late adulthood: 60+) </p><p>each stage represents a period of transition that is characterized by the development of hopes and dreams, consolidation, evaluation in the face of challenges, further change in life (e.g. identity crises and self-doubts) and re-evaluation in relation to the reality of one’s world view. For instance: </p><p>1 Early adult transition (17–22) As one enters adulthood, there is a sense of excite- ment about establishing independence in relation to one’s own parents. one opens up to a new world of ideas, embracing its uncertainty about where one stands in relation to one’s own aspirations. one has choices to make: entering </p><p> </p><p>further or higher education, entering a career or establishing a family. At such a critical juncture, one may experience self-doubt about one’s own ability to cope with the change in responsibility, as one senses the world’s expectations and demands (Who am i? What kind of person do i want to become?). </p><p>2 Provisional adulthood (22–28) This is a period of establishing one’s competence at being independent along one’s chosen path of development. </p><p>3 Age 30 transition (28–33) Around this age, one is likely to settle down with a job and develop one’s career. However, one may sometimes question one’s own commitment to one’s organization or to the relationship one is engaged in (is this what i really want to do, to become? Whom do i want to be with?). one has choices: to leave the job and change one’s circumstances; or to end a relationship. </p><p>4 Settling down (33–40) This is the time to grow roots and reap the fruit of earlier efforts. </p><p>5 Mid-life transition (40–45) Around the age of 40, one may recognize one’s own unfulfilled ambitions (lost hopes or broken dreams). one may feel tired of what one is doing and begin to question one’s own commitment again, asking deeper questions (What is the meaning of life? What is it all about?) This critical moment is often called mid-life crisis. </p><p>6 Restabilization (45–50) At this stage, one is likely to settle down with an established career. it is the time to bear fruit, develop still further and mentor others. </p><p>7 Age 50 transition (50–55) This is another critical moment for self-reflection (per- haps the result of another lost hope or broken dream); at the same time one feels somewhat out of touch with what is going on out there in relation to the younger generation; one has a sense of loss and regret for opportunities missed in the past (What have i achieved? What do i really value?). </p><p>8 Middle adulthood (55–60) one’s inner calm is restored. one may realize one’s limit, experience uncertainty about one’s own longevity and realign one’s prior- ities, in life and in relationships. one can afford to make choices in accordance with one’s own value and sense of identity. one may develop still further and make one’s assets grow; alternatively, one may choose to disengage from work or re-engage in new work or in a new enterprise. </p><p>9 Late adult transition (age 60–65) This probably represents the final stage of transition, during which one may need to plan ahead for the remaining years. Further reflection may take place, and hopefully one can enjoy the rest of life. </p><p>Later on, Levinson (1997) interviewed 45 women aged 35 to 45 and found that, although women may go through similar life stages, the rhythm of change tends to be different and they tend to be more concerned with the family and social aspects of life. Again, we need to be cautious about applying the life stages theory presented above too rigidly when we assess one’s development. The theory was developed on the basis of a study of a small number of people within the American culture. it could not accommodate the diversity of human development. in particular, it does not pay heed to different life stages, which mark the rites of passage for people of a different sexual orientation, race, culture, religion and belief. For instance, the ‘late adult transition’ phase (60–65) usually represents the stage of retirement, construed in relation to the </p><p> </p><p>normal retirement age in Western societies. However, even in the West, the situation is now changing as a result of recent employment legislation, which in turn responds to changes in life expectancy and economic conditions. </p><p>The social constructive paradigm and cognitive–developmental theories: </p><p>Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development </p><p>Within the constructive paradigm, among the cognitive–developmental theorists, there are two forerunners whose ideas are relevant to learning, coaching and mentor- ing: Lev S. Vygotsky (1896–1934) and Jerome Bruner (b. 1915). Both regarded the role of culture as instrumental to cognitive growth and as an amplification of human intellectual power. </p><p>Central to Bruner’s theory is the idea of knowledge representation and how the representation of knowledge is used by children and adults to assist them in their understanding of the world. Bruner (1964) regards the process of learning as consist- ing of three specific stages of knowledge representation: </p><p>1 Enactive representation The knowledge is represented in the physical action. Although one may not be able to describe the knowledge, one is able to explain it through action, as if the muscle has its own memory (motor responses) – for example, by pointing out a direction. </p><p>2 Iconic representation This is a spatial–temporal imagistic representation of the per- ceptual input, and it is based on the experience of events in the world. </p><p>3 Symbolic representation This is the expression of learning to use signs and symbols – for example, language, to describe an experience of the world. </p><p>Through a number of experiments in which children were introduced to a series of problem-solving tasks of progressive difficulty, Vygotsky (1962, 1978) revealed the existence of a learning gap between an ‘actual developmental level’ and a higher level of ‘potential development’ under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, more sophisticated peers. This gap is called the zone of proximal development, and it is rele- vant to our discussion of the coaching definition (as exemplified by Tony Grant; see Chapter 4). People consult coaches and mentors when they face barriers that prevent them from improving their performance at work or from fulfilling some aspiration in their lives. in other words – they ‘got stuck’. in these situations people tend to repro- duce the problem solutions or the behaviours that are familiar to them from past experience. Adopting Vygotsky’s developmental method, this gap between the known and familiar, and what is possible to know and do, can be understood in terms of the ‘zone of proximal development’. </p><p>Although Vygotsky’s research focuses on child development and childhood learning, in our coaching and mentoring context the concept of a zone of proximal development is also relevant to adult learning. We could regard coaching and mentoring as a form of social collaboration. in this collaboration the skilled coach or mentor provides supported learning tasks, which are within the reach of the coachees or mentees but require the investment of significant effort. Through this social col- laboration, with the help of a set of goals, challenges and actions, coachees and men- tees have the opportunity to distance themselves from their immediate experience of the world and to move towards what might be possible to know. </p><p> </p><p>This development of complex thinking provides a foundation for the development of ‘concepts’. The development of a concept presupposes more than unification. To form a concept it is also necessary to abstract, to single out elements, and to view the abstracted elements apart from the totality of the concrete experience in which they are embedded. </p><p>This conceptual development provides a foundation for the learner to intervene in the shaping of his or her own actions and life. The learner is now able to operate with these concepts independently, according to the demands of the task, and with an awareness of these operations, understanding them to be processes of a certain kind. it is this development that leads to self-mastery. This concept of development is the foundation of deliberate attention, logical memory, abstraction, and the ability to compare and to differentiate (Vygotsky, 1962). This development of conceptual thought is the foundation of personal agency. it is by developing concepts and personal agency that learners begin to inhabit their own lives. </p><p>in this scaffolding of proximal development, coachees are supported in performing manageable learning tasks, called ‘distancing tasks’, as they incrementally and pro- gressively ‘travel’ from one zone to another. According to Vygotsky, there are five levels of distancing tasks: </p><p>1 Low level: tasks that encourage people to characterize specific objects/events of their world (characterization of initiative; description). </p><p>2 Medium level: the development of chains of association (‘complexes’) by establish- ing relations between these objects and events (relation: initiative in relationship; analyses/pattern matching). </p><p>3 Medium to high level: tasks of reflecting about, realizing, and learning about specific phenomena from the chains of association (evaluation). </p><p>4 High level: tasks that abstract the reflection, realization and learning from their concrete and specific circumstances in the formation of concepts about life and identity (understanding, making judgements and decisions). </p><p>5 Very high level: tasks that formulate the planning for and the initiation of actions; tasks that predict the outcome of specific actions founded upon this concept development (conclusion/recommendation). </p><p>Vygotsky’s learning theory and narrative coaching </p><p>Vygotsky’s idea of constructing a scaffolding to help the learner create a bridge between zones of proximal development has been embedded in narrative therapy (White, 1997, 2000, 2006). When i first introduced the narrative approach to one of the community coaching programmes in the UK during 2006, narrative coaching was a relatively novel application (Law, 2006b; Law, Aga and Hill, 2006; Hall, 2006b: 10; see also the case study in Chapter 9 for an example of the application). Similar devel- opments of narrative coaching have also been advocated by david drake (2006, 2007, 2008b, 2009) in Australia and by Reinhard Stelter (2007, 2009) in denmark. While my collaborators and i ground coaching in narrative approaches, these developments have evolved quite independently. The theoretical foundation of drake’s approach seems rooted in the psychodynamic tradition, which has different implications for the practice. The theoretical foundation and the methodology that are advocated in this book are grounded, respectively, in social development theories of learning and </p><p> </p><p>in narrative–collaborative practice. They embody Michael White’s approach and represent further synthesis as a result of further narrative collaboration (Stelter and Law, 2009, 2010). </p><p>There are two central foundations of the narrative approach: </p><p>1 a societal/cultural foundation, which consists of conversation as a reflective space and self-created meaning making and uses the metaphors of the coachee’s own culture (e.g. Turner, 1967; Myerhoff, 1982); </p><p>2 a learning foundation, in which learning functions as process of co-creation of knowledge – this is Vygotsky’s (1962) proximal development – and as a situation and part of a community of practice. </p><p>in many situations learning is integrated into the social process and becomes part of it. The knowledge generated in this way is a joint ‘product’, evolved from the social negotiations of the community of practice. Thus learning has an important influence on one’s self and identity development. Learning takes place when the individuals or groups are ‘disturbed’ from their routines in such a way that their habitual modes of thinking and understanding can no longer be applied to solving specific problems or challenges. Thus learning is also part of a self-created discovery. </p><p>To summarize what has been said about learning so far, learning is essentially a process that always starts from specific experiences in a concrete social and material environment. This process builds on two interrelated dimensions: </p><p>1 individual meaning making; </p><p>2 social interaction → co-creation of meaning. </p><p>in the narrative practice, dialogue between coach and coachee is an essential vehicle in helping the coachee to construct knowledge and meaning. According to Hounsell (1984), there are two kinds of dialogue: </p><p>1 surface approach: direct interpretation from dialogue into ‘text’ – as for example in learning by rote; </p><p>2 deep approach: further processing of the textual information to extract meaning from it. </p><p>Individual meaning making </p><p>Meaning is an important element in constructive–developmental theories. Against ebbinghaus’ assumptions discussed earlier, we argue that meaning has an important role in learning. Kegan (1982) regarded meaning making as the irreducible ‘primary human motion’; and indeed its activities take place at three levels of interaction: </p><p>1 at the physical level (or more accurately at the psycho-sensory level) – that is, at a perceptual and cognitive level – in that it consists of (1) grasping the concrete experience through the sensory perceptors; (2) processing the information inter- nally through a set of sensory and neuro-networks; and (3) making sense of the perceived experience (i refer this as the internal transformation in the learning cycle in Figure 3.1); </p><p> </p><p>2 at the social level, in that it requires others and their social interaction; </p><p>3 at the level of survival, in that it is something one lives for. </p><p>At the cognitive level, meaning, perception and processing are two essential components in learning. For example, david Ausbel (1968) proposed that the ‘cognitive organiza- tion’ and ‘processes of meaning’ are two key elements in his ‘meaningful reception learning theory’. According to this theory, the information we hold in our memories (cognitive structure) is stored in a hierarchical form: knowledge that is more general (or common knowledge) can be remembered more easily and stands at the top in this representation, whereas more specific knowledge stands at the bottom and is difficult to remember. This structure forms the basis for learning, and new ideas are integrated within it. The specific and relevant ideas that the learner already has (Ausubel called these ‘anchoring ideas’) help learners to interpret meaning derived from their new experiences/information by providing this meaning with a point of entry in the existing cognitive structure. it is possible to integrate the new knowledge into the existing struc- ture at three levels (according to the assimilation theory of meaning processing): </p><p>1 Subordinate (subsumption): new ideas are integrated below the existing cognitive structures of the learner. one learns a new concept either by adding it to an exist- ing structure (as a derivative) or by modifying/extending the existing structure (as a correlative). </p><p>2 Coordinate (combinatorial learning): This is the learning of information that does not relate specifically to pre-existing knowledge but aids learning in other general areas. </p><p>3 Superordinate: new information is learnt that is integrated above existing cognitive structures of the learner. This happens for example when one comes to know a phenomenon across many instances of it, then learns its name, thereby unifying all these occurrences. </p><p>our understanding of Ausbel’s meaningful reception learning theory can be improved by incorporating Bartlett’s (1932) notion of schema or packet of knowledge (hence the so-called schema theory; see Anderson, Spiro and Anderson, 1978) and by understanding how knowledge is represented there. A schema is ‘a data structure for representing the generic concepts stored in memory’ (Rumelhart, 1980). Schemata, like a set of variables, theories or procedures, form our mental model for a particular situation, place, person, or event (e.g. in terms of formal logic: Z = X + Y, with an in- stance: c = a + b). We access these schemata when tr ying to make sense of a situation by filling in gaps of what we are experiencing (instantiating the missing variables with the default values, for example c = a + ? – where ? = b). Therefore our mental model directs our learning and affects our performance (Johnson-Laird, 1983; norman, 1983). Formal logic can explain why one could infer the fact that a canary has wings, and therefore can fly, from the higher schema stored with the instance that a canary is a bird and that birds have wings and can fly (Collins and Quillian, 1969). The knowledge acquisition and representation are updated flexibly in order to accommodate new facts and exceptions – for example, ‘the ostrich is a bird, but it cannot fly’. The adaptive updating of schemata is referred in Anderson’s ACT (adaptive control of thought) model (Anderson et al., 1978). </p><p> </p><p>Learning must permanently alter our schemata, so that they continuously guide us towards managing new situations in the light of new experience. This is done through the following processes (see Rumelhart and norman, 1978; Rumelhart 1980; Vosniadou and Brewer, 1987): </p><p>•  accretion – which happens when new information is added (instantiated) into a schema, ‘filling gaps’ in our existing knowledge (e.g. Y = b); </p><p>•  tuning – a process of refinement; prior knowledge is modified with new information, and the schemata evolve to become more consistent with experience (Rumelhart and norman, 1978); </p><p>•  restructuring – or the creation of new schemata to replace or modify existing ones (Rumelhart and norman, 1981). This involves a degree of trial and error, in that we use an existing schema to help interpret the new situation. if the old schema is correct – in other words, if it fits in with the new experience – we are likely to incorporate it in our newly created one. But if it is incorrect we will replace it with our more up-to-date experience (what we have learnt). </p><p>Meaning is formed through our actual experiences and through the knowledge that the individual implicitly acquires from them in different life contexts. To make meaning, first one needs to make sense of an experience (Mezirow, 1990). According to our discussion so far, this is essentially a reflective process, which is influenced by individ- uals’ assumptions, beliefs and values as well as by the culture (Cranton, 1996). We ascribe our actions, our experiences and interactions with others, and our life and work to specific values. These values evolve in the interplay between our acting, sensing, reflecting and telling specific stories – about ourselves and about the world we live in. These stories become meaningful. Through stories we begin to understand our own way of thinking and acting. Meaning is a central concept in a narrative approach. </p><p>Social learning theories </p><p>Like Vygotsky, Jean Lave and etienne Wenger (1991) locate learning within the social context of conversation – a co-participation they called ‘legitimate peripheral partici- pation’ (LPP). Learning emerges from a kind of social practice that facilitates LPP. Wenger’s (1998) social learning theory regards social interactions (such as everyday conversations) as part of the human condition – namely processes in which we learn and become who we are (we acquire self-identity). Social learning theories regard learning as: </p><p>1 part of human nature (it is not a specific process that can be separated from everyday lives); </p><p>2 a form of meaning production, in other words an ability to discover, construct and negotiate new meanings (learning is not a mechanical process); </p><p>3 an emergent property that creates structures (Wenger regarded the ‘community of practice’ as part of ‘the social learning structure’); </p><p>4 social experience; </p><p>5 a process of transformation or identity development, insofar as it transforms </p><p>practices, communities and one’s identity; </p><p>6 a process related to the development of histories (or ‘trajectories of participation’, which do develop histories) – personal as well as communal (or collective); </p><p>7 a form of personal/social development and management of personal boundaries (we may have multiple forms of membership in relation to our participation and identity – for instance, one may be a mother, a teacher, a student, a friend... depending the situation and social context); </p><p>8 a part of social energy and power, namely as a process related to power relation- ships, economies of meaning and membership in society (this resonates with Myerhoff’s (1982) notion of membership as a metaphor for self-identity, where life (in this case society) is regarded as a ‘club’; therefore one is free to choose and manage one’s membership or the membership of one’s own ‘life club’); </p><p>9 a part of our social engagement, and one of our opportunities to enter (or acquire membership in) particular communities of practice, which enable such engagement; </p><p>10 a part of our imagination – of one’s identity in a wider context; </p><p>11 a form of alignment; </p><p>12 an interplay between local and global contexts within and between which a </p><p>community of practice operates. </p><p>According to Wenger (1998), social learning theory is in fact an embodiment of a number of interrelated theories: </p><p>1 Theories of social structure: these emphasize the community or the organizational structure, its norms and rules as the primary object of study; social patterns and structures should be accounted for because they determine the actions of individ- uals who live in them. </p><p>2 Theories of situated experience: these value individuals’ experience and action – and the notion of agency – as the primary object of study. Studies of human–environmental interactions are a good example. </p><p>3 Theories of practice: these focus on the social activities that produce and repro- duce the practice – the local culture – of a given community. </p><p>4 Theories of identity: these examine the formation of self-identity from social and cultural perspectives – for example, from the perspective of social categories such as age, class, ethnicity, gender and so on. </p><p>in addition to these four types, Wrenger (1998) adds: </p><p>•  Theories of power, which question the conceptualization of power rather than following the status quo. </p><p>•  Theories of subjectivity, which explain how subjective experience emerges from social interactions. </p><p>•  Theories of meaning, which examine the production of meanings and culture socially rather than philosophically – namely how meaning is produced through social participation and how it is owned by individuals in relation to power. </p><p>•  Theories of collectivity, which examine how groups or communities are formed and sustained. These groups range from local ones (families and villages) to global communities (states, the global network, or global movements). These theories </p><p> </p><p>also attempt to explain how social actions are produced and reproduced, for </p><p>example as culture or social cohesion. </p><p>What kind of social experience constitutes learning? More specifically, ‘[l]earning can be defined as a realignment of experience and competence, which pulls the other. it is therefore impaired when the two are either too distant or too closely congruent to produce the necessary generative tension’ (Wenger, 1998: 227). </p><p>Wenger’s (2009) later work outlines four fundamental components of social learning in terms of social system and learning capability: </p><p>1 social learning spaces: meeting places that allow genuine conversation and active engagement among learners about their experience; </p><p>2 learning citizenship: a code of ethics of learning that ensures substantial commit- ment from the participants, their willingness to participate rather than to be imposed upon; </p><p>3 social artists: people who provide inspiration to learners and address the ‘social dynamics’ at work in the complex system; </p><p>4 learning governance: learning is part of wider social systems that require some principles of ‘governance’ to guide the configuration of the social learning space and of its processes in order to optimize the learning capability of the system (the ‘system’ being the community). </p><p>The components of learning presented above reflect a shift in the way we focus on learning. Understanding, meaning making and learning are situated in a social context and emerge as a result of interpretation rather than developing a fixed cognitive structure (knowledge representation). Placing emphasis on them represents a shift in the learning paradigm, from the cognitive to the social. For educators, researchers, coaches and trainers, Wenger’s social learning theory raises new questions about learning, for example: </p><p>•  What kind of social interaction provides the optimal condition for learning? </p><p>•  What social context can best facilitate such interaction? </p><p>•  What are the forms and structure that enhance (rather than hinder) learning? </p><p>in mentoring (and in coaching), although the mentee is the one who benefits most from the mentoring process, the context that best facilitates their interaction is the whole social context in which both of them, mentor and mentee, act as expert performers in their own right within their own domain of knowledge; as a result, both benefit from such collaboration. Viewed from the social learning perspective, coaching or mentoring pro- vide a form of LPP in which learning would take place (for both participants). </p><p>Applying Psychology of Learning to Develop a Coaching and Mentoring Framework </p><p>As we have seen from the review of some key learning theories in psychology, the learning process is a developmental process and the coach–coachee interaction is crucial in the transformation that leads to development. </p><p> Three essential elements of learning theories emerge from the above literature </p><p>review: </p><p>1 experience; 2 reflection; 3 meaning. </p><p>Reflective learning theories overlap with constructive development theories in terms of knowing how learners understand. Both kinds of theories emphasize the contribution of past experiences to present and future engagements. The self-agency for change anchors on an internal discourse – seeing the world through one’s reflective lens. it shapes the future direction with the intention of reframing one’s understanding. </p><p>The paradigm of coaching and mentoring as reviewed in Chapter 2 focused on the future (see Figure 2.1). However, coachees and mentees usually do have psychological barriers to moving forward, towards a future destination. The goal exists in the form of hopes and dreams in a ‘here and now’ state. The barriers may be based on unex- amined beliefs – for example, ‘the future looks too foreign and threatening’. on the other hand, if the coaching condition that the coach or mentor created were too familiar, the coachees or mentees could not move forward, as they would be directed to dwell on the past: the learning wheel would ‘get stuck’. There is also the matter of the inevitable challenge of learning in a metaphorical comfort zone, where more elements are fixed and familiar, rather than in an uncomfortable or out-of-comfort zone, where more areas are fluid and ambiguity is commonplace. A very fixed per- ception of the environment in which we operate helps us sustain and perhaps ‘freeze’ change and learning in exchange for security and safety; but a fluid environment is conducive to exploration and reflection, and safety is sacrificed for the sake of learning. The fixed world is a convenient perception, perhaps based on stereotypical thinking and past experience, and it leaves us without due appreciation for the distin- guishing features of the environment we now operate in and for the players we are relating to. Thus coach and mentor need to create a transitional state – a condition that is neither too new nor too familiar for the learner to rise up to the occasion. See Figure 3.3 (also Figure 3.1). </p><p>There are problems with some of the early work in this field, which presupposes that homogeneity generates better learning relationships. People tend to seek rela- tionships where there is a high rate of point-by-point correspondence; this facilitates easy empathy. Research into interpersonal attraction has shown that similarity in atti- tudes, political beliefs and religiosity predicts attraction. Byrne and nelson (1965), Festinger, Schachter and Back (1950) and Allport (1954) described prejudice as a faulty and inflexible generalization, namely negative regard for another group. So, when we experience difference in our relationships with others – either at a personal level or in the environment of operation – we might negatively transfer an attitude directed at a group to one of its individual members. Further, the representation of difference as something generating discomfort – something to be ‘overcome’ rather than savoured, assimilated and desired – is prejudicial in itself. </p><p>The greater the differences we perceive between ourselves and others within our cultural context, the greater the perceived unfamiliarity. This results in discomfort within ourselves, which may cause negativity towards individuals who are different </p><p>Upward transformation in the coaching/mentoring/learning paradigm </p><p>from us. This may include a range of attitudes, behaviours and characteristics. This is the leap many writers have taken when communicating the metaphorical comfort zones for learning in a cross-cultural paradigm. in coaching and mentoring, as in learning, this notion of belief needs to be questioned. </p><p>We hear that success in leadership is demonstrated by working successfully across traditional boundaries (working in new areas, with new clients, with new partners, in new ways) – in other words, through the ability to move regularly beyond boundaries and fixed positions or zones. Those who want to learn know that they will only be stretched if they engage with someone who has a different perspective – at least in one dimension; and the greater the number of different zones they bring to the ‘party’, the greater the number of new possibilities for learning. Thus if we map the learning wheel and the coaching and mentoring paradigm onto each other (i.e. if we overlay Figure 3.3 onto Figure 3.1), we have a dynamic coaching/mentoring model that is based on learning (Figure 3.4). </p><p>if we look from the framework described above, we can see the six substages of reflection described in the earlier section effectively overlapping the three realms of the learning wheel: past experience → meaning → new future. </p><p>The movement towards the new future destination becomes a resultant force (from the upward and forward transformations). This diagonal upward force defines the rolling mechanism. As some coaches would say, ‘let’s get the ball rolling’. Towards the end of this rolling or learning cycle or process, the coachees’ or mentees’ internal consciousness emerges, which is reflected in their behaviour – and this is equivalent to Schön’s notion of thinking in action. </p><p>in practice, the resulting progression from past experience to future aspiration may not be straightforward – either in the coaching and mentoring arena or in the real world. in fact to a lot of coachees and mentees, from junior managers to chief. </p><p>    Concrete experience </p><p>executives at the very top, the journey of living the dream could be extremely chal- lenging. one of the barriers usually cited is the difficulty of adapting to a new culture. For some individuals, whether they are company directors or new immigrants, adapt- ing to a new culture produces loss of meaning: somehow meaning is lost during this journey. The cause may be the lack of social references, or perhaps the challenge of a new experience. The phenomenon is well known from the new imigrants’ experience of alienation. However, as far as chief executives and senior managers are concerned, it may be equally true that ‘it is lonely at the top’, as the saying goes. While these people may well have experienced how meanings are formed in their earlier journey of career and life, they may also have suffered from the experience of how those very meanings were challenged and lost. one of the challenges for coaches is to find a way to sustain and revitalize the coachees’ personal meaning at that juncture of their lives; for meaning making involves feeling and thinking. To understand someone’s meaning is not like understanding an idea or an abstract concept – something that can be bought off the shelf – but to experience it deeply and personally within the context of a shared culture. </p><p>Like good teachers, coaches and mentors would need to acquire skills in order to unpack the process of meaning making (for example, narrative approaches mentioned earlier and some of the exercises described in Chapters 7 and 8) and to help learners to form or rediscover their own meaning and take responsibility for it. Thus meaning making is an important intervening step in our equation of the internal transforma- tion. Mapping this new substage onto our dynamic coaching/mentoring model in Figure 3.4, we have a more complete model (see Figure 3.5). </p><p>Understanding the above framework, we could appreciate how a concrete experi- ence in coaching or mentoring could be transformed into a personal development and extended into broader commitments, meanings and purposes. To use Mentkowski’s apt phrase, ‘the distance, future, and past can seem immanent in the lived moment, making such moments pregnant with meaning’ (Mentkowski, 2000). </p><p> </p><p>Reflection </p><p>Action </p><p>External transformation: towards behaviour </p><p>Abstract conception Meaning NEW future </p><p>Coaching / Mentoring / Learning condition </p><p>PAST experience </p><p>Concrete experience </p><p> Internal transformation: consciousness emerges </p><p>   Figure 3.5 </p><p>variable </p><p>dynamic coaching/mentoring/learning with meaning as an intervening </p><p>There may also be a precursor stage in the learning journey in a wider socio-cul- tural context, where individuals need to be clear where they are and to feel secure in their own identity before they can explore new dimensions, stimulated by different perspectives and angles but not based on core empathy. Core empathy might be achieved by high similarity with one’s learning facilitator on the key defining ele- ments of identity. in the course of developing a framework that is both universal and applicable across different cultures, we aim to unpack some of these key elements (as will happen in Chapter 6). The dynamic coaching/mentoring model discussed so far is grounded in the psychology of learning. We have found that it is very useful, as it could be readily applied to many coaching approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Chapter 7 shows how CBT could embed the dynamic model in practice. </p><p>Chapter Summary and Reflection </p><p>i started this chapter by first describing the development of positive psychology as a philosophical foundation for coaching, then reviewing a range of learning theories and identifying their contribution to a universal framework for coaching and mentor- ing. From reading this, you may find that some of these theories do not always support your practice and some areas may have more utility than theoretical insight. in this rapidly changing global market, the ability to learn quickly, in transition, outside of an established (and over-programmed) framework, is increasingly important. Working across different contexts with different people is a matter of positive curiosity, not of discomfort. Here discourse means open and objective dialogue, which challenges biased or distorted beliefs and assumptions (Mezirow, 1996). </p><p> </p><p>our discussion of a positive psychology framework in coaching, mentoring and learning has also highlighted its departure from psychotherapy. We hope that readers will understand the reasons why certain psychotherapeutic approaches might not be applicable in coaching, mentoring and learning and why in these arenas there might be a risk of inappropriate application of psychotherapeutic approaches, in particular in the context of cross-cultural diversity. </p><p>Taylor, Marienau and Fiddler (2000) summarized the common features of the learning process outlined in various theories by describing it as a process of ‘resolving contradiction in dialectical fashion’. in this process, the following characteristics are identified: </p><p>•  increase in awareness; </p><p>•  new possibilities; </p><p>•  multiple perspectives; </p><p>•  new ways of viewing the world and oneself; </p><p>•  active responsibility for the world. </p><p>To sum up, here are the factors that underpin the learning process and are relevant for coaching, as they may have a significant impact upon the learner’s experience and upon the learning outcome: </p><p>•  action – doing (some social activities); </p><p>•  barrier (this may be transformed into a set of bridging tasks); </p><p>•  becoming; </p><p>•  change; </p><p>•  culture; </p><p>•  champion – a leader, a facilitator, coach or mentor (Wenger called this kind of </p><p>person a ‘social artist’); </p><p>•  community – social system; </p><p>•  conversation; </p><p>•  discourse – open and objective dialogue, challenging biased or distorted beliefs </p><p>and assumptions (meaning schemes, Mezirow, 1996); </p><p>•  ethics – learning citizenship; </p><p>•  governance – learning governance; </p><p>•  meaning and purpose; </p><p>•  practice; </p><p>•  space – social learning spaces; </p><p>•  self-identity – sense of belonging.
