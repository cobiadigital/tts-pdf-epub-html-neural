Some of the questions are relatively insignificant: <span class="ePub-I">What should I have for breakfast? Shall I read this news article or skip to the next?</span> Others are more important: <span class="ePub-I">Should I take on that new project? Talk to my boss about a problem that has come up at work? Is it time for our family to start looking for a new house?</span></p>\r\n<p class="TX">It is perfectly natural, and reasonable, to want to answer such questions as soon as possible. Why waste time being indecisive? Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to decide on what to wear or whether to take that new job offer, the clock is ticking. There\xe2\x80\x99s often no \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d answer\xe2\x80\x94or if there is one, who knows what it might be? And so, we figure, there\xe2\x80\x99s no point overthinking it\xe2\x80\x94might as well choose what feels right in the moment or, to put it another way, \xe2\x80\x9cgo with your gut.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n<p class="TX">One can justify this approach by pointing out that a number of top business leaders are known for making critical decisions by relying on \xe2\x80\x9cgreat instincts\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or so the glowing profiles in the business press tell us regularly. The \xe2\x80\x9cgut\xe2\x80\x9d truly became hip after Malcolm Gladwell\xe2\x80\x99s popular 2005 book, <span class="ePub-I">Blink</span>, which told stories of split-second, instinctive decisions that turned out astonishingly well.</p>\r\n<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_22" title="22"/>But a growing body of research has concluded that our instincts\xe2\x80\x94our natural tendencies to think or react in certain ways when faced with a decision\xe2\x80\x94aren\xe2\x80\x99t as trustworthy as we might believe. We\xe2\x80\x99re subject to inherent biases, false confidence, irrational risk aversion, and any number of decision-making pitfalls. Katherine Milkman of the University of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s Wharton School, who has researched and written extensively on decision-making, says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe science simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support the value of following your gut<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#nid_18" id="nid-18">1</a></sup>\xe2\x80\x94in fact, it supports exactly the opposite approach to decision-making.\xe2\x80\x9d The psychologist and decision-making expert Daniel Levitin concurs: If you make decisions based on instinct, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cyour gut is going to be wrong more than it is right.\xe2\x80\x9d<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#nid_19" id="nid-19">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p class="TX">So what can we do about that? When it comes to important decisions, we can put less trust in feelings and more in evidence. We can seek input from outside sources and differing perspectives\xe2\x80\x94to try to see past our own biases and limited views. We can generate more options to choose from when making a decision (which experts say is a key element in arriving at better decisions). We can also factor in our innate tendencies to be overly cautious or too focused on short-term benefits, and strive to make decisions that are bolder and more forward-looking.</p>\r\n<p class="TX">But we can\xe2\x80\x99t do any of that unless we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to think about\xe2\x80\x94and ask questions about\xe2\x80\x94the decisions we make, as we\xe2\x80\x99re making them. In this section, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at why you should question your decisions (or at least some of them) and which questioning strategies seem to be most effective. We\xe2\x80\x99ll consider how you can use self-questioning to make more balanced decisions as well as make more courageous ones to help overcome fear of failure. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see that asking the right questions can even help with the biggest decisions\xe2\x80\x94such as figuring out where your passions lie, so that you can decide which goals and dreams to pursue.</p>\r\n<p class="TX">As for the smaller decisions\xe2\x80\x94choosing the right coat to wear or the best route to work this morning\xe2\x80\x94not every choice made during the course of the day must be subject to rigorous questioning. People do, after all, have to get things done. Mike Whitaker, author of <span class="ePub-I">The</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_23" title="23"/><span class="ePub-I">Decision Makeover</span>, advises that rather than spending time analyzing small decisions, \xe2\x80\x9chave fun with them.\xe2\x80\x9d<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#nid_20" id="nid-20">3</a></sup> Use them as an opportunity to be spontaneous or creative. <span class="ePub-I">Ice cream for breakfast?</span> Go with your gut.</p>\r\n<p class="TX">But the decisions that matter\xe2\x80\x94in your business or your career, in personal relationships or financial investments, in the voting booth\xe2\x80\x94are worthy of more thought. This brings us quickly to one of the problems of decision-making: Many of us don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly <span class="ePub-I">like</span> to think about difficult decisions. The process can be uncomfortable and unsettling.</p>\r\n<p class="TX">Hard decisions demand that we make a choice in the midst of uncertainty; they force us to confront the unknown. Fortunately, the question is a tool designed for this precise situation. Questions enable us to \xe2\x80\x9corganize our thinking around what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#nid_21" id="nid-21">4</a></sup> says Steve Quatrano of the Right Question Institute, an inquiry research group.</p>\r\n<p class="TX">Think of your innate questioning skills as a flashlight and the decision ahead of you as a dark room. Each question illuminates a new area (and the better the question, the more light it casts). As we confront the various unknowns surrounding a tough decision, each question\xe2\x80\x94<span class="ePub-I"><a id="pg_23-1"/>What am I really trying to decide here? What\xe2\x80\x99s most important? What critical information do I have and not have?</span>\xe2\x80\x94enables us to see a little more clearly, and helps us to step forward in the face of uncertainty.</p></div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>'
