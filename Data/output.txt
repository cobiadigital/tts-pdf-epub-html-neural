['<speak><p class="cn">CHAPTER THREE</p><p class="ct">My first anchor</p></speak>', '<speak> Over that decade nearly every Scot living between the Borders in the south and Angus in the north was directly affected by war and plague. Conquest, slaughter, famine and death, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, seemed in the 1540s to be riding across Scotland, and many had their lives thrown into disarray or worse. By contrast much of Knox’s turmoil in that decade was internal, as he moved from being a Catholic priest to becoming a Protestant preacher. He later suffered considerable physical hardship and illness when sentenced to enforced exile aboard a French galley. On release eighteen months later, Knox remained in exile for safety and served as a Protestant cleric within the Church of England. Religiously and geographically, the notary from the banks of the Tyne had travelled to new lands.</p></speak>', '<speak> These radical changes to his beliefs and career gave Knox an entirely new identity and brought a new calling that shaped every aspect of his future life.</p><p class="ahd">TASTE OF THE TRUTH</p></speak>', '<speak> As his faint praise of Gillem indicated, Knox found him worthy and boring. The friar was of ‘solid judgement, reasonable letters (as for that age) and of a prompt and good utterance: his doctrine was wholesome without great vehemency against superstition’. Knox was more appreciative of the sermons delivered by another former Dominican, John Rough, who joined Gillem in a tour of East Lothian. Compared to Gillem, Rough was, ‘albeit not so learned, yet more simple and more vehement against all impiety’. Here was an early indication that Knox prized zealous vehemency above solid and learned exposition.</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="txt">In 1543 hopes had soared among the supporters of Church reform at the Scottish royal court and wild rumours circulated as to who might join this evangelical campaign. The high moral standard and intellectual ability of John Hamilton, then Abbot of Paisley, made him a likely candidate. The euphoric bubble was soon burst that had envisaged the future Archbishop of St Andrews stepping into the pulpit to ‘preach Jesus Christ’. Hamilton returned from France and persuaded Arran, his half-brother, to reverse the controversial diplomatic and religious policies. The Regent’s subsequent reconciliation with Cardinal Beaton ensured that Arran’s ‘godly fit’ came to a juddering halt. The brief religious earthquake of 1543 seemed to have left little damage to the Scottish status quo.</p></speak>', '<speak> A number of prominent clerics, such as the Englishman Cardinal Reginald Pole, realized they faced the hard choice between their understanding of justification and the preservation of the unity of the Church, and most opted to remain within the Catholic Church. When a General Council was finally called to meet at Trent in northern Italy in 1545, only members of the Roman Catholic Church gathered. However, in Scotland, which did not send a formal delegate to Trent, the time for such irrevocable decisions was fifteen years away and unbridgeable boundaries had not yet emerged.</p></speak>', '<speak> The Earl of Angus’s extremely able brother, Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich, had a base near Lasswade to the west of Haddington from where he re-established the Douglas network within the region. At this early stage in their respective careers Knox probably first encountered Pittendreich’s son James, later Earl of Morton and Regent to King James VI, who was to prove so important to the Scottish Protestant cause. Knox’s new post placed him within this committed evangelical group, who had the political goal of achieving religious reform through alliance with King Henry VIII of England. During the subsequent Anglo-Scottish wars this East Lothian grouping became open allies of the English.</p></speak>', '<speak> The Cardinal’s political and ecclesiastical power was increasing, making it essential for Knox to avoid any overt repudiation of his priesthood that would draw the attention of the Church courts and place his patrons, as well as himself, in danger of heresy proceedings. Following the hectic flurry of 1543, Scottish evangelical groups returned to their previous pattern of keeping a low profile by concentrating upon Bible reading and limited discussion among themselves. This was an alternative style of domestic piety that by the exercise of discretion on disputed doctrinal points was able to coexist within the institutional Catholic Church. In later life Knox possibly felt embarrassed that during this period he had kept his head firmly down and his nose buried in his books, the very model of a conscientious schoolmaster. Such behaviour was normal among Scottish evangelicals and was changed only by the arrival of the Protestant preacher George Wishart.</p></speak>', '<speak> Alongside the importation of Bibles came English anti-papal works that had justified the Henrician break with Rome and Royal Supremacy.</p><p class="txt">Whether it was his own copy or one owned by Douglas of Longniddry or Cockburn of Ormiston, Knox probably had access to the Great Bible authorized by King Henry VIII. He certainly used this version during his later ministry in Edwardian England and developed a great affection for its translations, which slipped seamlessly into his thinking and writings. The University of Melbourne currently holds a copy of the Great Bible, known as ‘John Knox’s Bible’. This was specially printed in France in 1566 as a presentation copy to Knox from Thomas Cardine or Cawarden. Such a gift indicated that Knox either had specifically chosen this translation or was known to be particularly fond of it.</p><p class="ahd">JOHN 17</p></speak>', '<speak> Since ships carried more than one anchor, Knox probably also meant John 17 was his most important line of safety, holding secure his sense of salvation. For him this chapter provided a summary of the good news of the Gospel.</p></speak>', '<speak> ‘I pray not for these alone, but for them also which shal beleve in me, through their worde, That they all may be one, as thou, o Father, art in me, and I in thee … I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.’</p></speak>', '<speak> The Geneva Bible later appended a long note to this verse: ‘our election standeth in the good pleasure of God, which is the onlie fundation and cause of our salvation and is declared to us in Christ, through whome we are justified by faith and sanctified’. Christ’s promise that believers would be with him and see his glory was further explained: ‘that they maie profit and growe up in such sort that in the end they may enjoy the eternal glorie with me’. In his later tract about predestination the assurance that believers would enter into the same glory as Christ and that God’s love for the elect was immutable were two of the three points that Knox drew from this Johannine chapter. His third point highlighted another favourite theme: the close union between Christ and the believer. This mystical union was the route by which the believer understood the love of God, ‘for without him we can not comprehende the love wherewith God loveth us’.</p></speak>', '<speak> However, what he took from John 17 in the early 1540s was sufficient to change his beliefs and his life and to give him a firm anchor for his new faith.</p><p class="ahd">MASTER GEORGE</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="ftxt">Another chapter from John’s Gospel gave Knox one of the images he employed most frequently, that of Christ the Shepherd, with a particular stress placed upon the voice of the shepherd and how the sheep followed that voice and no other. When Knox attended the sermon by the Protestant preacher George Wishart in Leith on 13 December 1545, he heard that voice and experienced a personal call to follow it. For the ensuing five weeks he became Wishart’s disciple and accompanied him everywhere. From that initial encounter he never doubted Wishart’s prophetic status or the divine origin of his words. In later life he might even have ‘heard’ the voice of God speaking with Wishart’s tones. Wishart undoubtedly made an immense impact upon Knox that cut right across his life, reordered his thinking and propelled him in a new direction.</p></speak>', '<speak> By the time Knox was accompanying Wishart, the preacher was consciously walking the road towards martyrdom. He was intent upon handing on to the Scottish evangelical movement the radical vision of Reformed theology that demanded a complete rejection of the Catholic Church and a stress upon the primacy of Scripture. He gave Knox and the other evangelicals a new ecclesiology, complete with a new view of the ministry of preaching and prophecy, a new understanding of the sacraments and new ways of worship.</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="txt">Knox’s meeting with Wishart marked a dramatic and vital second stage in his three-step transition from Catholic priest to Protestant preacher. In his <emphasis level="moderate">History</emphasis> he laconically recorded his first encounter with Wishart using the third person and with minimal detail, referring to ‘John Knox, who had awaited upon him [Wishart] carefully from the time he came to Lothian’. Significantly, this was the moment Knox chose to introduce himself for the first time into his narrative. He desired the closest possible association in the <emphasis level="moderate">History</emphasis> between himself and the man he called ‘Master George’, his hero and role model. He wanted his readers to receive their first impression of John Knox as Wishart’s disciple and sword-bearer.</p></speak>', '<speak> His unambiguously Swiss Reformed teaching with its total rejection of the Catholic Church and its new ecclesiology sharpened and defined their views. The early evangelical movement in Scotland had been given an overtly Protestant edge.</p></speak>', '<speak> Carrying the great sword was a grand gesture and Knox probably employed the weapon as a processional prop carried in front of Wishart, ceremonially clearing his way. These staged entrances to demonstrate the preacher’s importance probably came easily to a man who grew adept at recreating dramatic scenes in words. Knox was also making explicit his own changed status because priests were not supposed to bear arms or spill blood.</p></speak>', '<speak> In some of his public pronouncements the preacher could be harsh and vindictive, as in his condemnation of two Franciscan friars who had come to disrupt his sermon in Inveresk: ‘O sergeants of Sathan, and deceivers of the souls of men, will ye neither hear God’s truth, nor suffer others to hear it? Depart and take this for your portion – God shall shortly confound and disclose your hypocrisy: Within this realm ye shall be abominable unto men, and your places and habitations shall be desolate.’</p></speak>', '<speak> During his own ministerial career he instinctively thought of the religious battle within a military context, explaining on one occasion that the Mass was more of a threat than if ten thousand enemy soldiers had landed.</p><p class="ahd">THE BLESSED MARTYR OF GOD</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="ftxt">Writing in his <emphasis level="moderate">History</emphasis> twenty-one years later about ‘Master George’, Knox was intent upon presenting a Christ-like figure. He introduced Wishart as almost beyond compare, ‘a man of such graces as before him were never heard within this realm, yea, and are rare to be found yet in any man’. Like the Jesus of John’s Gospel, in Knox’s narrative Wishart moved towards his death with a clear awareness of his fate. He preached, tended the sick and plague-ridden, protected those who would have killed him, overcame temptation alone and steadfastly endured his trial and final martyrdom. At many points Knox introduced direct parallels with Gospel scenes to make the identification impossible to escape. This went beyond conventional hagiography and placed Wishart at least on a par with the Christ-like figure of St Francis.</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="txt">Knox spent a mere five weeks in Wishart’s company during a preaching tour demanding constant movement between venues and different overnight accommodation to avoid detection. In his <emphasis level="moderate">History</emphasis> he recorded only one personal conversation with his hero. On the day of the final sermon in Haddington, a letter arrived that indefinitely postponed the public debate in Edinburgh that Wishart had particularly sought. The preacher had wanted to talk and share his doubts about the future while Knox was on tenterhooks because the time for sermon was approaching and he had no wish to intrude upon Wishart’s preparation. Not only was Wishart paralleling the reversals and doubts Christ faced in his last days, he foreshadowed the feelings and language Knox used in 1566 when writing that section of the <emphasis level="moderate">History</emphasis>. Wishart’s phrase ‘weary of the world’ became Knox’s refrain in his own final years.</p></speak>', '<speak> Being such a pastor of a flock was the duty of every Protestant preacher, though Wishart held a special place for Knox as the perfect reflection of the Good Shepherd and his personal role model.</p></speak>', '<speak> Once the arrest had been made, and despite the Earl of Bothwell’s promise to the contrary, Wishart was handed over to Cardinal David Beaton and sent to St Andrews. In Knox’s Passion-style narrative this was Wishart’s Jerusalem, where he was tried, condemned and executed on 1 March 1546. The ‘death of the blessed martyr of God’ automatically placed all Wishart’s associates in danger. At this point Knox considered leaving the country for Germany and a visit to the centres of Continental Protestantism. In the end he probably laid low in East Lothian waiting for Beaton’s major crackdown on heresy that did not come.</p><p class="ahd">THE KINDNESS OF GOD</p></speak>', '<speak> Under his guidance Knox rediscovered the security of belonging to the Church, catholic in the sense of universal, but opposed to the visible institution of the Scottish Catholic Church in which he had been raised.</p></speak>', '<speak> In Articles 5 and 13 of the <emphasis level="moderate">Confession</emphasis>, Wishart had chosen ‘kindness’, a word replete with significance for Scots, to describe the believer’s kinship with Christ and the saving grace received by faith. Faith was also described in this homely way: ‘we hope for to come to the kyndnes of God’.</p></speak>', '<speak> In his later ministry Knox showed the greatest patience with those, like Elizabeth Bowes, who worried that they and their salvation were unsafe. Knox found as many ways as he could to explain that believers’ safety and assurance did not rest with them but lay in the sacrifice and merits of Christ. Being Christ’s, these merits were eternally safe and secure, available to all those who as believers were Christ’s kin and united with him. By finding these simple terms that conveyed to his listeners a wealth of subtle Scottish associations, Wishart wrapped his Swiss Reformed theology in a cloak of recognizable colours that looked both familiar and comforting.</p></speak>', '<speak> In a remarkably comprehensive way he absorbed the ecclesiological lessons Wishart had taught. He accepted the teaching about the nature of a Reformed Church and just a year later, without needing to pause for thought, he himself translated those ideas directly into practice in St Andrews.</p></speak>', '<speak> He deliberately modelled his ministry upon what he had seen and heard Wishart do. After he had entered that ministry he concluded that Wishart’s prophetic mantle had indeed fallen directly on to his own shoulders, just as in the Old Testament the prophet Elijah’s mantle had passed to his successor, Elisha. Following Wishart, Knox combined the prophetic and preaching duties of admonition, explaining, ‘therefore must the truth be plainlie spoken that the simple and rude multitude may be admonished’.</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="txt">Most of the ideas Knox received from Wishart would have been heard in sermons. The aural impact of Wishart’s words remained firmly in his memory and he incorporated them into his <emphasis level="moderate">History</emphasis>. Having been carried away by Wishart’s language and delivery in the pulpit, Knox turned this style of denunciation into a major element within his sermons. He also acquired Wishart’s fondness for contradistinctions and selected as illustrations of Wishart’s preaching those occasions his mentor had moved into prophetic denunciation, as at Haddington. Wishart had been angered by the rapid diminution in attendance due to Bothwell’s prohibition and felt Haddington had spurned him as the messenger of God. He launched into a condemnation of the burgh and its inhabitants.</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="ex_alone">O Lord, how long shall it be that thy holy word shall be despised, and men shall not regard their own salvation? I have heard of thee, Haddington, that in thee would have been at a vain Clerk play [mystery play] two or three thousand people; and now to hear the messenger of the Eternal God, of all thy town nor parish can not be numbered a hundred persons. Sore and fearful shall the plagues be that shall ensure this thy contempt … yea, thou Haddington, in special, strangers shall possess thee … and that because ye have not known, nor will know the time of God’s merciful visitation.</p></speak>', '<speak> ‘And so did God perform the words and threatening of his servant, Master George Wishart, who said, "That for their contempt of God’s messenger, they should be visited with sword and fire, with pestilence, strangers, and famine."’ In Knox’s narrative the preacher’s miraculous powers of foresight and the accuracy of his predictions were given centre stage. According to his followers, earlier in his preaching tour Wishart’s foresight had saved his and their lives. When writing about the attempted ambush near Montrose Knox crafted his story with great skill to heighten the dramatic tension and emphasize the supernatural powers Wishart possessed. He underlined Wishart’s Christ-like knowledge not only of his approaching death but also of its timing.</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="txt">Wishart inspired his disciple Knox to follow his doctrine and his ministry. With that sincerest form of flattery, Knox imitated his hero. He might have started in a superficial way by growing a black beard as long as Wishart’s and for the rest of his life he sported a beard down to his chest in best prophetic style. This was probably the only aspect of Wishart’s appearance he could reproduce, since his role model was tall, very thin and ascetic looking and had a sallow complexion. As an ardent disciple, Knox also copied Wishart’s expressions and vocabulary. Ten years later when searching for a suitable denunciation of Mary of Guise, he reproduced almost exactly Wishart’s earlier phrasing.</p></speak>', '<speak> Although Knox did not put this into practice during Wishart’s lifetime, this new understanding of ministry made possible his final acceptance of the call to preach in St Andrews the year after Wishart’s execution. In addition to the pivotal role of preaching, a minister was responsible for administering the sacraments. Wishart had taught that the seven sacraments of the medieval Church should be reduced to two: baptism and the eucharist or Lord’s Supper. Wishart’s guidance and teaching were made strikingly obvious in St Andrews during 1547. Thanks to his mentor, in that burgh Knox was able to administer the Lord’s Supper in a ‘Reformed’ manner.</p></speak>', '<speak><p class="txt">The targeting and removal of ‘additional’ ceremonies flowed from Wishart’s entire approach to worship, that all its aspects should be based directly on Scripture. Knox accepted with great enthusiasm this substantial extension of the concept of the primacy of Scripture. In his later career he pushed his premise still further by accepting both the positive rule and its negative corollary. For Knox the negative aspect dominated, declaring that nothing should be present in worship which did not have an explicit biblical warrant. It was accompanied by the positive formulation that only things expressly commanded in Scripture should be practised, a step further than many other Reformed theologians were prepared to go and one that contained problems for the future. Employing the logical method he had learned at university, Knox created a syllogism and it became one of the foundations of his thinking. In more modern times, this has become known as the regulative principle.</p></speak>', '<speak> After the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, Knox wrote an <emphasis level="moderate">Order for a General Fast</emphasis>, and as a result public fasting within a strong prophetic and apocalyptic context became a distinctive feature of early modern Scottish life.</p><p class="txt">Wishart’s example through deeds as well as words gave Knox a fresh understanding of what constituted the Church. It opened up new possibilities for Knox and, less dramatically and much more slowly, for his fellow Scottish evangelicals. Little of the theological content Wishart had brought on his return to Scotland was entirely new, but his charismatic preaching and personality made an incalculable difference. He gave the Scottish evangelical groups a dynamism and sharply defined direction that produced a nascent Protestant movement. For a recent convert such as Knox, no other man could compare to his ‘Master George’. Wishart was a shining living embodiment of a new vision of the Church. Having lost his Catholic anchors, once he had heard Wishart’s sermons Knox was able to grasp this new certainty with relief and conviction. Wishart had proved to him that the new anchor of his Protestant faith would hold and that he was aboard the vessel of the true Church. He had given Knox a new ecclesiology and a model for his future ministry.</p><break time="3s"/></speak>']
