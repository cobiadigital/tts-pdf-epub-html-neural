    <p id="_idParaDest-8" class="chtitle"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>The Constructionist Principle</p>

    <p class="quote ParaOverride-13">We don’t live in a world of reality, we live<br /> in a world of perceptions.</p>

    <p class="quote ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-18"> ~ G</span><span class="CharOverride-19">ERARD</span><span class="CharOverride-18"> J. S</span><span class="CharOverride-19">IMMONS</span></p>

    <p class="first">The Constructionist Principle conceptually underlies the other principles in Appreciative Inquiry (AI.) The essential premise is that life experience doesn’t just happen to us, we actually create it together. This concept is quite deep and fairly abstract, but it has profound implications for how we participate in life. This chapter is one of the most difficult to get through, but offers some of the most valuable insights in how we create our lives. David Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a> first wrote about this principle with consulting partner Diana Whitney:<a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a></p>

    <p class="blockquote">Simply stated—human knowledge and organizational destiny are interwoven…we must be adept in the art of understanding, reading, and analyzing organizations as living, human constructions. Knowing stands at the center of any and virtually every attempt at change. Thus, the way we know is fateful.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-008">8</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker024"></a> and Whitney<a id="_idIndexMarker025"></a> are addressing organizations, but each of us is, in effect, an organization. We construct our understandings of who we and others are, and these constructions become our reality.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Within the Constructionist Principle, Diana Whitney<a id="_idIndexMarker026"></a> and Amanda Trosten-Bloom<a id="_idIndexMarker027"></a> say that “meaning is made in conversation, reality is created in communication, and knowledge is generated through social interaction. These exchanges can be verbal or non-verbal, and they add that language is the vehicle through which we create our understanding of the world. Harlene Anderson<a id="_idIndexMarker028"></a> expands on this last point:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">We are in continuous conversation with each other and with ourselves. Through conversation we form and reform our life experiences and events; we create and recreate our meanings and understandings; and we construct and reconstruct our realities and our selves. Some conversations enhance possibility; others diminish it.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-009">9</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Social constructionism suggests there is no true reality “out there.” We are each creating our own version of “what’s really going on,” and no two people see it exactly the same way. We each live in the worlds we have created, which include our beliefs about who we are.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Although we are creating our own individual experience of reality, we are deeply influenced by others in our constructions. The next section describes the nature of this influence, which is so pervasive we are often not aware of the extent to which others shape our beliefs and experien<a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>ce.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-9" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Reality is Co-Created<a id="_idIndexMarker029"></a></p>

    <p class="quote">I have learned silence from the talkative, toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind; yet strange, I am ungrateful to those teachers. ~Kahlil Gibran</p>

    <p class="first">We come to understand the world as we engage with other people, ourselves, cultures, animals, nature, a higher power etc. Reality is basically our experience of what is going on in any given moment, and our self-image is part of that reality. Who we are and what we believe about things are not fixed notions, but are continuously re-created in conversations and communications with others. We are <span class="CharOverride-15">linguistically constructed, relational selves.</span><span class="CharOverride-20"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> Let’s consider a practical example of how this works.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Example of Co-Creation</p>

    <p class="first">Susan grew up in a middle class suburban culture, where responsibility was a valued trait that had been passed down through many generations. Her parents talked to her about responsibility, told stories of others who acted accordingly or not, and rewarded her for acting responsibly. They shaped her understanding of responsibility as following through on what she promised and doing what was expected. Susan’s understanding was sharpened and reinforced in school and later in the workplace with good reports, awards, and recognition for responsible behavior. She observed mother animals responsibly caring for their young, and honed her understanding further. Her religious organization taught that responsibility was good and would be rewarded in the end. The media emphasized the importance of being consistent with the prevailing norms and expectations of society, which added further to her construction.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Susan has come to <span class="CharOverride-15">believe</span> that responsibility is a good trait and one that she possesses. Her understanding is unique, since no one else comes at it with the exact same set of experiences and conversations that she does. Others will view responsibility differently based on their particular influences.</p>

    <p class="Normal">As Susan talks with a friend about responsibility, they <span class="CharOverride-15">co-create</span> or <span class="CharOverride-15">co-construct</span> understanding together through language. Each girl influences the other, and the meaning they create together is sometimes said to exist in the “conversational space” between the two of them.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> The following story of Susan as a teenager illustrates the idea of co-construction:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Susan sees her new friend Shawna<a id="_idIndexMarker030"></a> running towards her in the hall at school. She gets that uneasy feeling inside as Shawna approaches. “Hey Susan,” Shawna exclaims, “let’s get out of here and go to the park for a few hours. Mr. Davidson will never miss us!” Susan can feel her head swimming. The voices of her mother, teachers, family, friends, religion, and culture instantly race through her mind with opinions about what she should do. She looks at the ground, and says, “I don’t know about just leaving like that.” Shawna jumps in, “What’s wrong with just having a little fun?” Susan shifts uneasily and begins to wonder about all the fun she misses out on by following the rules. She looks at her beliefs about responsibility from a new perspective and replies, “How about if we stop at the cafeteria and get a drink before the next class instead?” As innocent as this may sound, it is a radical thing for Susan to do. Shawna pauses and reflects on the realization that her new friend is one of those people who always follows the rules. She considers what it would be like to live that way for a moment, and shifts her beliefs slightly about the value of responsibility. She rolls her eyes and sighs, “Well, okay.”</p>

    <p class="Normal">Each girl will walk away from the interaction with newly co-constructed<a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a> notions of responsibility, how important it is, and how it fits into her personal identity. The shift might be slight, but both will have gained new understanding through this interaction that will be melded in with previous beliefs and experiences.</p>

    <p class="heading2">The Collective Person</p>

    <p class="first">Susan from the previous example has come to believe that responsibility is a good trait and one that she possesses. This understanding was created within the context of all her relationships. Although Susan experiences it as her own individual belief, it is actually a <span class="CharOverride-15">collective</span> or <span class="CharOverride-15">co-created</span> belief, in that it is a product of many different interactions. Susan develops her self image from the culmination of all her co-constructed beliefs. She develops her beliefs about others in the same manner.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Jane Galloway Seiling uses the term “collective person<a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a>” to represent the notion that each of us is a collective product of all our interactions. She uses the metaphor<a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a> of the formation of the Mississippi River to describe the formation of the self.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> She explains how the river begins with droplets from the originating streams and tributaries, and grows with additions from other small and large rivers, fields, and streams. She describes how the droplets all merge together to form the river, and it would be difficult to determine the influences or origins of any one drop. She concludes that each person is like the Mississippi: a collective notion formed and altered through the contacts, experiences, learnings, desires, and actions of multiple others.</p>

    <p class="Normal">The collective person<a id="_idIndexMarker034"></a> suggests that all we know and believe about ourselves and others is a subjective opinion based on the views and conventions of the families and schools and societies in which we live. These beliefs continuously change as we engage with new people and experiences, and we are never the same person from one moment to the next. We are viewed differently by each individual, and our self-concept is simultaneously molded and reformed by that very person. It is through the eyes of others that we come to know ourselves and all that we experience.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Our collective self makes sense within the communities and cultures in which we live. If Susan were suddenly transported to an inner city gang culture her notion of responsibility would change dramatically. Her beliefs and behaviors would be viewed as foreign by this new group, and what she has come to believe about herself and reality would be challenged.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Strong beliefs we have about our collective self and reality can eventually become truths<a id="_idIndexMarker035"></a>. A truth<a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a> is simply a belief we have come to accept as true to a stronger degree than other beliefs. It is the relationships around us that keep our beliefs and truths<a id="_idIndexMarker037"></a> relevant and intact.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-10" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Truth<a id="_idIndexMarker038"></a> is Local</p>

    <p class="quote">Our own life is the instrument with which we experiment with truth<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-013">13</a></span></span>. ~Thich Nhat Hanh</p>

    <p class="first">Because social constructionism suggests there is no absolute truth<a id="_idIndexMarker039"></a> or objective reality,<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> we all create our sense about “what’s really going on” in a way that is unique to us. Our understanding is not the “truth” about what is happening, it is only our version of it. Others will experience the same situation differently and come to different conclusions about “what’s going on.” I saw a bumper sticker once that aptly proclaimed, “Don’t believe everything you think.”</p>

    <p class="heading2">Truth<a id="_idIndexMarker040"></a> is a Construction</p>

    <p class="first">Life is not experienced in a vacuum. We simultaneously integrate our past and present beliefs as we construct a new reality with others. As we hear over and over from different sources that being responsible is a good way to live, we begin to view that as “truth<a id="_idIndexMarker041"></a>.” We come to believe that it is better to follow the rules, do what we promise, and adhere to the standards and norms of our society. We carry that truth<a id="_idIndexMarker042"></a> into our next experience and act accordingly. It is only “truth” for us, from our relative perspective and framework of understanding. It will be viewed differently by others. For example, Hippies of the 1960’s considered it irresponsible to embrace the status quo; they responsibly rebelled against the norms of society.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Our constructions are continuously changing and are only “true” in this moment. In the next moment, as Susan from our previous example experiences a mid-life crisis, she may view her years of responsibility as a restraining noose that prevented her from living the life she really wanted to live. One significant event, such as winning the lottery, can shift a lifetime of beliefs about what we thought was true.</p>

    <p class="Normal">So, is responsibility a good trait? It depends on who you ask. The responsible, conscientious mother would answer “yes.” The defiant, rebellious teenager would respond “no.” Again, who is right? Social constructionists would say the question of who is right, or whose perspective is more valid, is not of issue. No two people will see it the same way, and one person’s truth<a id="_idIndexMarker043"></a> or reality is no more true than another’s. Let’s suppose we were to call in a “neutral” third party to determine the “real” truth. Again, his assessment will be a construction created within his unique framework of understanding, values, and life experiences. He might be seen as neutral to some, and biased to others.</p>

    <p class="Normal">What if the third party is an “expert” in psychology and moral philosophy? Now we are placing a value judgment on the quality of the construction. We are saying some people are more qualified to create the truth<a id="_idIndexMarker044"></a> than others. We do this every day and it serves an important function in making our world work. And yet, in the social constructionist’s view, the expert opinion is no more true in the absolute sense than anyone else’s opinion.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Local<a id="_idIndexMarker045"></a> Truth</p>

    <p class="first">Social constructionists are not suggesting we abandon the search for truth<a id="_idIndexMarker046"></a> as such, but instead that we recognize there is no ultimate truth or meaning that supersedes all others. There is tremendous value in creating what Kenneth and Mary Gergen<a id="_idIndexMarker047"></a> call “local truth,”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> an agreement about what is true within a community of people. This is fundamentally how we exist. The truths<a id="_idIndexMarker048"></a> that are created within communities have meaning and value within those communities, but not necessarily beyond. Beliefs about what is true are specific to these groups of people, and others outside the community may not see it the same way. Gergen and Gergen<a id="_idIndexMarker049"></a> describe this idea further:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">The idea of truth<a id="_idIndexMarker050"></a> within community is of enormous consequence…it is important within a community of rocket scientists to know whether it is true or false that a rocket will follow a certain trajectory; this truth is wedded to the value they place on safely reaching a destination…Our troubles begin, however, when local claims to truth (t) are treated as transcendental truth (T), when one community claims that the world was created by a Big Bang and another by a Big God<a id="_idIndexMarker051"></a>, when one claims that homosexuality is a disorder and another that it is a normal human activity, or one claims that all behavior is determined and another that people have free will. Like most claims to knowledge, the humility of the local is replaced by the arrogance of the universal.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-016">16</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="heading2">Authorities on Truth</p>

    <p class="first">There are some who contend that scientific truth<a id="_idIndexMarker052"></a> is the ultimate truth. “Data doesn’t lie,” is a common phrase in these communities yet there is always a person who must interpret the data and assign a meaning to it or significance of some sort. Subjective decisions are made about what data to collect, how to collect it, and what it ultimately means. Conclusions are determined from the data about what is relevant, true, important, and possible. As new scientific discoveries are made, the truth, beliefs, and possibilities expand. People previously believed the sun revolved around the Earth until Galileo proved otherwise. Quantum mechanics demonstrated the limits of Newtonian physics. Scientific facts and theories are discovered and become obsolete along with our personal beliefs.</p>

    <p class="Normal">There is one other common alleged authority on what is right and true: religious or spiritual<a id="_idIndexMarker053"></a> authority. This is tenuous territory upon which to tread, and possibly the most sensitive. If the higher power of any religion, be it God<a id="_idIndexMarker054"></a>, Buddha, Allah, or some other deity, bestows the “real” truth<a id="_idIndexMarker055"></a>, then consider how we gain access to that truth. Some find it in passages from their chosen sacred texts, or from the teachings of religious and spiritual<a id="_idIndexMarker056"></a> authorities. Others say they speak directly to God<a id="_idIndexMarker057"></a>, angels, spiritual<a id="_idIndexMarker058"></a> masters, or other entities. Regardless of the process or source from which we get the information, we must still interpret it and construct the meaning of it, through the lens of our personal values and beliefs. Two people studying the same Biblical passage may come away with different beliefs about the meaning of that passage. Even in matters of faith, we individually and uniquely construct our truth. Once again, it is not about whose truth is <span class="CharOverride-15">most</span> true, but about recognizing the personal and local nature of our individual truths<a id="_idIndexMarker059"></a>.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Let us be clear that social constructionism is not saying there is or is not a God<a id="_idIndexMarker060"></a>; that is up to each of us and what we choose to construct. I have very strong personal beliefs about God<a id="_idIndexMarker061"></a>, but that is my local truth<a id="_idIndexMarker062"></a>. It is based on my co-constructed beliefs in the same way an atheist proclaims there is no God<a id="_idIndexMarker063"></a>. Some think a woman’s right to choose abortion is a bad thing, others think it is a good thing. Some think conformity is desirable while others do not. The truth depends on the beliefs within the community of people whom you are asking.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Our spiritual<a id="_idIndexMarker064"></a> beliefs are some of the most deep and pervasive beliefs we hold. The miracle of life on earth, the purpose of our existence, the mysteries of life after death; our spiritual<a id="_idIndexMarker065"></a> beliefs address these questions and many others. They drive most of our daily decisions and actions, either directly or indirectly. Suggesting that such powerful beliefs may not be “true” in the absolute sense can be very unsettling, and even offensive.</p>

    <p class="Normal">This discussion begs the question, “Are we basically making it all up?” Well, yes we are, in a sense. We’re making it all up together. The point is not to lament the idea that there are no foundations for absolute truth<a id="_idIndexMarker066"></a>, but to acknowledge that the foundation of truth and belief on which we base our lives, is our own co-creation. It can be as small as a married couple believing in monogamy, or as big as the whole world believing that the earth is round.</p>

    <p class="Normal">In summary, our local truths<a id="_idIndexMarker067"></a> or common beliefs help us function and organize our personal experience. They provide tremendous value and importance in our affairs, but they are not absolute, and they are ours alone as a collective person<a id="_idIndexMarker068"></a>. This idea can be disconcerting at first, but ultimately it is empowering as we realize that we are much more free than we ever imagined to construct truth<a id="_idIndexMarker069"></a> in a way that ultimately serves us well.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-11" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>We See Things As We Are</p>

    <p class="quote">We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are. ~Anais Nin</p>

    <p class="first">We construct reality in relationships with others through the lenses of our beliefs, assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker070"></a>, traditions, and norms. We come into a situation with a lifetime of co-constructed filters that influence what we perceive in the moment. In this sense, we see things as we are, and not in some objective sense. We can expand our beliefs by opening up to the ways that others view a situation. The more different a person is from us, the greater the learning and growth potential.</p>

    <p class="Normal">We are never truly neutral observers. For example, if a young boy were to come upon a homeless man for the first time asleep in the street, the boy might determine that he is a camper who has lost his tent and is very fortunate in not having to take a bath. This conclusion would fit with the boy’s current beliefs and previous experiences of camping and bathing that he has determined as relevant.</p>

    <p class="Normal">If the same boy comes upon the homeless man with his mother, his construction will be influenced by her beliefs. If she is a homeless shelter volunteer, the explanation she gives about the man and what he is doing would probably be supportive and empathetic of his situation. If the mother is a disgruntled business owner who is losing customers because of the homeless disturbance, the description of the man and his choices would probably be a lot different. In each case she is viewing the situation through the lenses of her previous understandings and will influence the boy’s construction accordingly. As the boy questions his mother about why the homeless person lives as he does, there is an opportunity for the mother to reflect on her underlying assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker071"></a>, and expand the filter of her beliefs. The mother’s and boy’s individual understandings of homelessness will be co-created through their interaction as they talk about the homeless situation together.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Our underlying beliefs<a id="_idIndexMarker072"></a> and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker073"></a> play an important role in our normal functioning. They sometimes appear as liabilities in our discussions, but they provide us the opportunity to make sense of our world in an efficient way. They speed up our ability to make decisions and take action. We would be overwhelmed without them, given everything we have to process in a single moment. The suggestion in social construction is to take time when appropriate to question our underlying thinking<a id="_idIndexMarker074"></a>, thereby growing in understanding. The concern is that we can go through life on “auto-pilot,” automatically accepting and allowing our co-constructed beliefs and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker075"></a> to guide us through situations. This limits our ability to learn and grow with experience, since we tend to repeat the same things over and over.</p>

    <p class="Normal">When you begin to look at all the things you consider to be true through the lens of social construction, you realize that there are a lot of assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker076"></a> you have automatically accepted rather than intentionally and thoughtfully integrated. Does everyone want a lot of money? Have aliens visited the Earth? Do bad people go to Hell? Questioning our underlying assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker077"></a> allows us to expand our thinking.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Children provide a wonderful opportunity to surface assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker078"></a> and expand beliefs. Their relatively open filters lead to unique questions and comments that often stimulate interesting new insights. I have given pause numerous times to reflect on questions from my children such as: “Where does dirt come from?”...“Are you going to die before me?”…“Why do I have to wear clothes?”…“Are trees made of wood?”</p>

    <p class="Normal">I remember one particular family conversation that reminded me about local truth<a id="_idIndexMarker079"></a>. My 4-year old son was explaining that he wanted to be a fire fighter and a spaceman when he grew up. My husband said those sounded like good choices, since he would be able to do exciting things. My son replied in an indignant voice, “No Dad, it’s because they all wear boots.”</p>

    <p class="Normal">We become much less concerned about getting others to see it “our way” when we understand that we each experience a different reality. I could have tried to convince my son that traveling into space is more exciting than wearing boots, but in doing so I would be missing the opportunity to learn from his perspective. After all, maybe he’s “right.”</p>

    <p class="Normal">When we allow others in the conversation to have their beliefs without resistance, an interesting thing begins to happen:<span class="CharOverride-15"> we now have more time in the exchange for listening</span>. We begin to realize that the way we grow and learn is by listening to how others view a situation and the meaning they develop. We find that the more different a person is from us, the more it causes us to reflect on our taken-for-granted thoughts<a id="_idIndexMarker080"></a>, and the more we can learn. As we attempt to understand the unique way another makes sense, we open ourselves to new horizons of thinking and understanding. This is the value of diversity and the spirit of true inquiry.</p>

    <p class="Normal">We discover it is often valuable to try to see things another’s way<a id="_idIndexMarker081"></a> and then fit that into our understanding. Author and coach Stephen Covey writes that the “Fifth habit of highly effective people” is “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> We also find that other people become a lot more interesting as we let go of our need to be right, and attempt to discover more about them. Gay Hendricks describes it this way:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">…the central choice of conscious living [is] whether to open ourselves in wonder to what needs to be learned or felt or resolved, or to contract into opinion, belief, and justification…every utterance out of our mouths serves one of two intentions: discovery or justification.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-018">18</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">When we listen to others with the sincere desire to see it their way, a win-win situation occurs. We gain insight into our own underlying beliefs<a id="_idIndexMarker082"></a> and truths<a id="_idIndexMarker083"></a>, and our partners receive one of the greatest gifts another can bestow: to be heard.</p>

    <p class="Normal">When we accept the idea that we see things as we are, we can let go of our quest for who and what is “right” in the absolute sense. This opens us to new ways of knowing and offers opportunities for learning and growth. The more different people and experiences are, the greater the opportuni<a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>ty for learning, if we are open to it.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-12" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>We Are Deeply Inter-Connected</p>

    <p class="quote">We are each made and imagined in the eyes of one another. ~David Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker084"></a></p>

    <p class="first">It becomes apparent that we are deeply inter-connected when we consider the concepts of the Constructionist Principle. We are continually influencing and being influenced as we construct our reality. Our connections run deeper than we may be aware.</p>

    <p class="heading2">The Influences of Others</p>

    <p class="first">There are several bodies of research depicting our interrelatedness with others. The “Pygmalion<a id="_idIndexMarker085"></a> effect<a id="_idIndexMarker086"></a>” is one of the most well-known, as a special case of the “self-fulfilling prophecy” concept from psychologist Robert Merton’s work.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> “Pygmalion”<a id="_idIndexMarker087"></a> was the original name of the George Bernard Shaw play <span class="CharOverride-15">My Fair Lady,</span> which popularized the concept.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-020">20</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">In the classic Pygmalion<a id="_idIndexMarker088"></a> study,<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> teachers are told that their students have either high, average, or low potential. What the teachers do not know is that these assignments are random. Over time, the high potential students clearly emerge above the others, based solely on the expectations of the teacher. Literally hundreds of studies over the past twenty years have confirmed these results. Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker089"></a> explains that, “significant Pygmalion<a id="_idIndexMarker090"></a> effects have been experimentally generated in as little time as fifteen minutes and have the apparent capacity to transform the course of a lifetime.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-022">22</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Aspects of the placebo<a id="_idIndexMarker091"></a> studies further confirm the Pygmalion<a id="_idIndexMarker092"></a> effect<a id="_idIndexMarker093"></a>. These studies show that some people get better with “sugar pills” simply from their belief that the pills will work. What has also been documented is that the effects are strongest when the treating physician also believes in the effectiveness of the placebo<a id="_idIndexMarker094"></a>.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> Again this shows that the images projected onto us by others have quite an effect.</p>

    <p class="Normal">As discussed before, our identity is continuously molded and shaped by the influences of others. Consultant and author Margaret Wheatley<a id="_idIndexMarker095"></a> explains that, “Each organism maintains a clear sense of its individual identity within a larger network of relationships that helps shape its identity. Each being is noticeable as a separate entity, yet it is simultaneously part of the whole system.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> We influence the collective whole through our projected images, and the collective whole projects back on us.</p>

    <p class="heading2">The Greater Collective</p>

    <p class="first">There is an even more pervasive type of connection that has been suggested by some. Physicist David Bohm<a id="_idIndexMarker096"></a> describes it as the <span class="CharOverride-15">implicate order</span>,<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> biologist Rupert Sheldrake as the <span class="CharOverride-15">morphogenetic field</span>,<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> and psychologist Carl Jung as the <span class="CharOverride-15">collective unconscious</span><span class="CharOverride-15"><a id="_idIndexMarker097"></a></span>.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> Wheatley<a id="_idIndexMarker098"></a> summarizes Sheldrake’s concept of morphic fields<a id="_idIndexMarker099"></a>:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Morphic fields are built up through the skills that accumulate as members of the same species learn something new. After some number (not specified) of a species have learned a behavior, such as bicycle riding, others of that same species will be able to learn that skill more easily. The behavior collects in the morphic field, and when an individual’s energy combines with it, the field patterns the behavior of that individual. They don’t have to actually learn the skill; they pull it from the field.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-028">28</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">The essential proposition is that we are influencing and being influenced by a larger invisible, intangible field. Some also suggest that it’s not just humans and animals that participate in this larger collective. Random number generators have also shown erratic behavior in response to life events.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Senge<a id="_idIndexMarker100"></a> et al explain how random number generators<a id="_idIndexMarker101"></a> acted in non-random ways during the US terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The abnormal behavior matched the chronology of the terrorist attacks, beginning at 5am EST, peaking at 11am, and staying deviant into the evening.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> A report in the <span class="CharOverride-15">Foundations of Physics Letters</span> stated in response that, “we are obliged to confront the possibility that the measured correlations may be directly associated with some (as yet poorly understood) aspect of consciousness attendant to global events.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-030">30</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">One other controversial and exploratory area of study is the freezing water<a id="_idIndexMarker102"></a> research conducted by Masaru Emoto<a id="_idIndexMarker103"></a> of Japan. Emoto<a id="_idIndexMarker104"></a> subjects water<a id="_idIndexMarker105"></a> to a variety of conditions, and then takes pictures of the crystals<a id="_idIndexMarker106"></a> that form when it freezes. Senge<a id="_idIndexMarker107"></a> summarizes the results of Emoto<a id="_idIndexMarker108"></a>’s work in <span class="CharOverride-15">Presence</span>:<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> He describes how water<a id="_idIndexMarker109"></a> taken from polluted urban sources forms only partial structures, but water<a id="_idIndexMarker110"></a> from especially pure or healthy sources such as springs and deep wells, forms stunningly complex and beautiful structures.</p>

    <p class="Normal">The same results were obtained by writing certain words on the outside of vials of distilled water<a id="_idIndexMarker111"></a>. “For example, the word ‘beautiful’ in Japanese (or other languages) produces exquisite lacy crystals<a id="_idIndexMarker112"></a>, while the word ‘dirty’ produces undeveloped crystals<a id="_idIndexMarker113"></a> that you could only call ugly.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> In another experiment he showed the power of prayer to change the crystal structure<a id="_idIndexMarker114"></a>. Senge<a id="_idIndexMarker115"></a> explains:</p>

    <p class="Normal"><span class="CharOverride-12">…in one experiment they took water</span><span class="CharOverride-12"><a id="_idIndexMarker116"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-12"> from a highly polluted river reservoir and froze it. The samples had virtually no crystal structure</span><span class="CharOverride-12"><a id="_idIndexMarker117"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-12">. Then an elder priest, Reverend Kato, sat next to the reservoir and prayed for one hour for the well-being of the water</span><span class="CharOverride-12"><a id="_idIndexMarker118"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-12">. When they then took new samples of the water</span><span class="CharOverride-12"><a id="_idIndexMarker119"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-12"> and froze it, the crystals</span><span class="CharOverride-12"><a id="_idIndexMarker120"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-12"> were stunning…</span><span class="CharOverride-21"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-033">33</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-12"> </span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Senge<a id="_idIndexMarker121"></a> also states that the crystals<a id="_idIndexMarker122"></a> from water<a id="_idIndexMarker123"></a> that were exposed to music seemed to reflect the music: “the geometric precision of Bach, the balance of order and flow of Mozart, the beautiful simplicity of folk music.” Emoto<a id="_idIndexMarker124"></a>’s initial interest in this work stemmed from the fact that our adult bodies are about 75% water<a id="_idIndexMarker125"></a> by weight.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Our Inter-Relatedness</p>

    <p class="Normal">There is no denying our interdependency with others whether you agree with these theories or not. As Wheatley<a id="_idIndexMarker126"></a> explains, “None of us exists independent of our relationships with others. Different settings and people evoke some qualities from us and leave others dormant. In each of these relationships, we are different, new in some way.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> Stavros<a id="_idIndexMarker127"></a> and Torres<a id="_idIndexMarker128"></a> describe our inter-relatedness in their book, <span class="CharOverride-15">Dynamic Relationships:</span></p>

    <p class="blockquote">We are relational beings, integrally connected to one another and our environment. Our relationships deeply inform who we are and how we act, which in turn impact others at “this moment”—impacting the “next instant” in the relationship. Our actions and their impact on others are inseparable. We are interconnected.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-035">35</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">We are just beginning to explore the extent of our inter-connectedness with others in the west (though some cultures and religions have long held these views). We exist within a web of relationships that provide influence and meaning beyond what’s readily apparent. We realize that what we do to others ultimately affects us as well. It starts to become more about us and less about me as we shift from a sense of isolation to <a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a>one of connection. There are many who think our survival depends on it.<a id="_idIndexMarker129"></a></p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-13" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Words Create Worlds</p>

    <p class="quote">In language we build our own identities, our relationships with others, the countries that we live in, the companies we have, and the values that we hold dear. With language we generate life. ~Fernando Flores</p>

    <p class="first">“Words create worlds” is a common phrase in AI that captures the importance of language in our constructions. Narrative therapists Michael White and David Epston say that the reality we create and our self understanding is mediated through language.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> The words we use to communicate with others profoundly affect the meaning generated between us.</p>

    <p class="heading2">The Meaning of Words</p>

    <p class="first">The constructions that we make of reality are primarily created through conversations, yet Ken Gergen<a id="_idIndexMarker130"></a> describes how language is inadequate to fully convey meaning. There are many factors to consider in language, such as the words we choose, context, patterns of exchange, shared meanings, and so on.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> For example, there are some words such as “sadness” or “love” which encompass such a broad range of meaning, it is not possible to capture the essence in just one word. Entire poems are written to capture the fullness of a word such as love, yet no two poems are the same.</p>

    <p class="Normal">When we use a word such as love in a conversation, we have no way of knowing how it is being received. The other person may be totally misinterpreting our statement because he or she has a different understanding of the word we are using. Other forms of communication such as writing, pictures, and art are inexact for conveying meaning for the same reasons. The point is not to give up on trying to communicate, but to acknowledge that our ability to share meaning is limited with language and the meanings we individually attribute.</p>

    <p class="Normal">As much as words have limitation in their ability to convey meaning, our choice of words is very influential in the meaning that gets created. Organizational theorist Karl Weick describes how vivid words draw attention to new possibilities.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> He gives the example of how changing terminology from “intentional ill treatment” to “battered-child” was an important factor in mobilizing action for abused children. The realization of the power of words to convey meaning has caused other language shifts, such as moving from “handicapped” to “physically challenged” and from “black” to “African American.”</p>

    <p class="heading2">Metaphor</p>

    <p class="first">Metaphor is another interesting language scheme. A metaphor<a id="_idIndexMarker131"></a> is basically a word or idea that is used to represent a similar concept. For example, the metaphor of a growing plant might be used to represent a new, emerging business. When we combine the constructionist concept of truth<a id="_idIndexMarker132"></a> to metaphor, an interesting proposition emerges. If there is no real truth about things, then is a metaphor any less true than the thing it represents?</p>

    <p class="Normal">Gergen<a id="_idIndexMarker133"></a> gives the example of using the metaphor<a id="_idIndexMarker134"></a> of war to describe an argument.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> If we begin to think in terms of this metaphor, then our experience of an argument itself can become war-like. The next time we get into a disagreement, we may think in terms of war, and our personal experience will follow. If we change the metaphor for argument, as Gergen<a id="_idIndexMarker135"></a> suggests, to something such as dance, then our experience of an argument can take on dance-like qualities. The next time we disagree with someone, we may think in terms of moving or flowing with them, perhaps with the intensity of a Tango.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Metaphor is not just a helpful way to describe something, it actually creates the thing it describes. This is the concept of words creating worlds. Metaphors are powerful tools because they distance us from the concept, which breaks down our defenses. It is easier to look at and analyze something “out there” rather than in our selves or our organizations. We can look at areas of our lives that we want to improve and create metaphors that represent them. We can then study the metaphor<a id="_idIndexMarker136"></a> in a less threatening way and translate the insights into our personal life.</p>

    <p class="Normal">For example, if we continue with the dance metaphor<a id="_idIndexMarker137"></a> we could also apply it to a relationship with a significant other. We could study in what ways our relationship is like a dance; what it means to lead and follow, dance together and apart, dance the same dance, and so on. As we study the nature of dancing together we might become aware of insights that were too “charged” for us to see without the separation of the metaphor.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Other Linguistic Considerations</p>

    <p class="first">The use of metaphor<a id="_idIndexMarker138"></a> and other linguistic methods to affect change is applied extensively in therapy. Solution<a id="_idIndexMarker139"></a>-focused therapists O’Hanlon and Weiner-Davis believe that “the creative and mindful use of language is the single most influential indirect method for creating contexts in which change is perceived to be inevitable.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> The language changes they use are subtle, but powerful.</p>

    <p class="Normal">The first use of language they describe is verb tense. For example, when talking about a problem with a client, they describe it in past-tense. Instead of saying, “you have problem X,” they would say something like, “you’ve had problem X for a while now.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> When I first read this, I honestly thought it was too trivial to be of use. Over time I have come to see the value, but it is not necessarily obvious at first glance. The change is subtle, but it opens the door for a new possibility going forward. Instead of talking about our problems as things we have, we can talk about them as things we have had until now.</p>

    <p class="Normal">A second way O’Hanlon and Weiner-Davis describe the mindful use of language is in what they call <span class="CharOverride-15">possibility</span> terms versus <span class="CharOverride-15">definitive</span> terms.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-042">42</a></span></span> Instead of asking a client, “What <span class="CharOverride-15">will</span> you do when problem X occurs?” they ask something like, “What <span class="CharOverride-15">might</span> you do?” Again, the language shift is minor, but it loosens the hold on the fixed nature of problem responses and suggests that next time it might be different.</p>

    <p class="Normal">There is one final subtle language trend that I’ve observed across various disciplines. It is the use of verbs in place of nouns to capture the fluid, ever-changing nature of our selves and our reality. For example, Wheatley<a id="_idIndexMarker140"></a> and Kellner-Rogers<a id="_idIndexMarker141"></a> suggest it is more helpful to think of “organizing” rather than “organizations” to convey the continuous creation of structures, processes, and patterns of behavior that define them.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-043">43</a></span></span> Jane Galloway Seiling proposes decisioning as an ongoing process in organizations rather than decision-making as discreet actions.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-044">44</a></span></span> Personal consultants Walter and Peller like the term “preferencing” in therapy work rather than “goal,” to convey the non-linear complexities and spontaneity of human events.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> They also prefer “storying” rather than “stories” to reduce the notion of stories as a fixed, bounded concept that needs to be changed. (We’ll talk about stories in the Narrative Principle.)</p>

    <p class="Normal">Harlene Anderson mentions the term “one’s selves” in place of oneself. This better represents the collective nature of opinion that we have come to think of as our self. Another variation of this concept is using “human being” instead of “person.” This term implies the moment-to-moment nature of our humanness, where we are “being” who we are in one moment, and “being” something different in the next. Terms like appreciative organizing, appreciative living, and appreciative leading, also convey more fluid and dynamic notions than appreciative organizations, appreciative life, or appreciative leadership. I’m not proposing name changes, but simply pointing out how words affect our images and understandings in ways that can be subtle.</p>

    <p class="Normal">In summary, the theory and practice around language usage is extensive, and we’ve only touched the surface here. The main idea is that our choice of words not only describes our reality, but it creates it as well. Language is the medium through which we create meaning with others, and it has inherent limitations as well as opportunities. The more we understand this concept, the more deliberate we can be in selecting words that create more of what we want.<a id="_idIndexMarker142"></a></p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-14" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Final Thoughts</p>

    <p class="first">The Constructionist Principle is one of the deepest and most fundamental principles within AI. It suggests that reality is socially created, and there are as many versions of it as there are people. Our identity is part of our reality, and is an ever-emerging, collective product of opinions that we have accepted. There is no absolute truth<a id="_idIndexMarker143"></a> about ourselves or anything else, but local truths<a id="_idIndexMarker144"></a> are vitally important in helping us live and make sense of our world. We continuously co-construct reality through the lens of our simultaneously changing beliefs and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker145"></a>, and language is the vehicle through which we describe and create our lives.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-3">These ideas can be a lot to swallow. We are essentially saying that life experience does not happen to us: we continuously co-create it through our myriad of seemingly insignificant daily conversations. The good news about this idea is that we can let go of fixed notions of who we are and what we are living. The ab<a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a>ility to create our ideal life is as close as our next conversation.<a id="_idIndexMarker146"></a></p>
