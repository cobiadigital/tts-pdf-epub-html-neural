    <p id="_idParaDest-3" class="chtitle _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Introduction</p>

    <p class="quote ParaOverride-13">The real voyage of discovery consists <br />not in seeking new landscapes, <br />but in having new eyes.</p>

    <p class="quote ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-12">~ M</span><span class="CharOverride-13">ARCEL</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> P</span><span class="CharOverride-13">ROUST</span></p>

    <p class="first _idGenParaOverride-1">Appreciative Inquiry (AI) has transformed my life. My greatest wish and sincere intent in this book is to help others find the sheer joy in living that is available to all of us. AI has traditionally been used to transform organizations, but it is equally transformative in individuals. There are many who say that in order to “do it” in organizations, you have to “be it” in your personal life. This is a book about “being it.”</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">This book was written both for people who are familiar with AI in organizations, as well as those who are new to the concept. If you apply AI in organizations, living these principles will make you more effective in your organizational work as you “walk the talk.” If you are new to AI, you may experience a fundamental paradigm shift as you come to understand how you are creating the life you experience. You will also learn practical ways to shift your thinking and actions to create more joy and happiness than you ever thought possible.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">In the pages ahead we will journey into the conscious and unconscious domains of our minds as we explore how we think and what we say. I’ll explain how we create our personal identity and reality with others, and consider the tremendous implications of that concept. We’ll explore the nature of our underlying beliefs<a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a> and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a> and how they influence our present and future. I’ll discuss the rationale for shifting our thinking habits to notice the good and to appreciate the best in ourselves and each moment. We’ll look at the continuous nature of change and the power of questions and small steps to direct those changes. Finally, we’ll consider the impact of our images and beliefs about the future and learn ways to deliberately create what we want most.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-4" class="heading _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>How To Read This Book</p>

    <p class="quote _idGenParaOverride-1">Prepare your mind to receive the best that life has to offer. ~Ernest Holmes</p>

    <p class="first _idGenParaOverride-1">I wrote this book with two different kinds of people in mind: people like me who love to analyze things, and people like my dear friend Sandra who do not. Part I of this book, “The Philosophy,” is for people like me. It is full of the latest theory and research about AI across multiple disciplines, and goes into depth on the original and emergent principles. It explains why the AI principles make sense and how they work. I could just eat these chapters up.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Part II, “The Practice,” is for Sandra. She took a look at one of my favorite chapters and basically said, “Is anybody really going to read all this stuff?” I picked my ego up off the floor, and created Part II. Chapter 7 contains a simple three-step process we can use in our daily affairs to apply the AI principles. Chapter 8 includes exercises we can do to help shift our automatic thinking. The exercises are simple, and most can be done in 15 minutes or less.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Chapter 9 is “Nirvana” for the “Sandras” of the world. It contains bullet point summaries of all the ideas in the book and is a nice reference guide.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">If you want to really understand the principles, then I suggest you read and savor Part I before going on to Part II. If you don’t care to read through all the theory, then you might want to simply skip to Part II, “The Practice.” If you have questions about any particular area, you can always go back into the earlier chapters to learn more. Either way, enjoy!</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-5" class="heading _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>What is Appreciative Inquiry?</p>

    <p class="quote _idGenParaOverride-1">The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true. ~James Branch Cabell</p>

    <p class="first _idGenParaOverride-1">AI was first conceptualized at Case Western Reserve University in 1980 by doctoral student David Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a> and his thesis advisor, Suresh Srivastva<a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> Jane Watkins and Bernard Mohr provide a beautifully detailed history of the beginnings of AI in their book, <span class="CharOverride-15">Appreciative Inquiry: Change at the Speed of Imagination</span>.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> They describe the detailed events of how AI began as a theory-building process and eventually evolved into the change philosophy it has become today.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Fundamentally, “AI is about the co-evolutionary search for the best in people, their organizations, and the relevant world around them.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> It is a positive, strength-based approach to change. It includes co-creating inspiring images of what we want, and then building on positive aspects to make them happen. It means becoming more aware of our internal and external dialogues and intentionally shifting them to focus on what we want more of. It unleashes the positive potential within people and situations through attention and focus on the positive core. It suggests we build on our strengths, successes, and best practices to achieve our greatest hopes and dreams. AI is all this and more.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">AI is a “living,” “organic” concept that continuously emerges and grows with new learning and information. This book contains new thinking from various disciplines that is consistent with the principles of AI and adds to the evolving repertoire of beliefs. Appreciative Living is simply applying Appreciative Inquiry in everyday life.

    <p id="_idParaDest-6" class="heading _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>The Principles of AI</p>

    <p class="quote _idGenParaOverride-1">We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark. The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. ~Plato</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">In the early 1990’s, David Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a> created the five original principles<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> of AI under the guidance of Suresh Srivastva, which <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>describe the basic tenets of the underlying philosophy. The five principles are: the Constructionist Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>, the Poetic Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>, the Simultaneity Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>, the Anticipatory Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>, and the Positive Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a>. A summary of all the principles can be found in Chapter 9.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">AI consultants have recently started adding to the principles to reflect new learning and thinking. In 2003 Diana Whitney<a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a> and Amanda Trosten-Bloom<a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a> proposed three additional principles in their book <span class="CharOverride-15">The Power of Appreciative Inquiry</span>. They are: The Wholeness Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>, the Enactment Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>, and the Free Choice Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> These principles were created out of the authors’ experience with large-scale organizations and community change work in an effort to further define the ever-emerging concept of AI. In addition, Frank Barrett<a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a> and Ron Fry<a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a> are proposing the Narrative Principle in their book <span class="CharOverride-15">Appreciative Inquiry: A Positive Approach to Cooperative Capacity Building</span>.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> Finally, Jackie Stavros<a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a> and Cheri Torres<a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a> recommended the Awareness Principle in their book <span class="CharOverride-15">Dynamic Relationships: Unleashing the Power of Appreciative Inquiry in Daily Living.</span><span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-007">7</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Each chapter in this book contains the relevant theory and practices that have emerged around the original and emergent principles from different disciplines. These disciplines include social construction, positive psychology, strength-based therapy, chaos theory, self-organizing systems, biology, quantum mechanics, and others. The concepts in these chapters are by no means all-inclusive. As I now write I sit with a shelf full of unread books, bulging with ideas that would add to this discussion. There came a time when I had to freeze my thoughts and understandings and write it all down.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">The important thing to remember is that Appreciative Living is a journey and not a destination. It requires deliberate effort over time to shift our automatic thinking and open our minds and hearts. These pages present a pioneering look at the AI principles, and a few of the myriad of ways to incorporate them into our personal lives.</p>
