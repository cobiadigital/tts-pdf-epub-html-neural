    <p id="_idParaDest-2" class="chtitle _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor001"></a>Acknowledgements</p>

    <p class="first _idGenParaOverride-1">There are many people who have contributed directly to the creation of this book, and many others who supported me in the process. I wrote this while also being a full-time mother of two young children, so you can imagine how long this list will be.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">I’ll begin at the beginning, with Dawn Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a> Dole, the woman who first encouraged me to write. Dawn is one of the great unsung heroines within AI, who works diligently behind the scenes in many capacities to keep AI moving forward. She not only prompted me to create this book, but in doing so helped me discover a passion for writing that might otherwise have lain dormant for years. I can’t thank her enough.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Then there is my primary editor, Jane Galloway Seiling, who began working with me at the start and never left my side. She was more than an editor, she was a sponsor and dear friend. She got me back on track during periods of confusion, and encouraged me to stop reading and start writing.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Rita Demarco-Madden is one of my closest friends and mentors, and we deliberated many aspects of this book together. She read every word I wrote and has been such a gift to me in more ways than I can put in writing.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">There were many family members and friends who helped out at various stages. My brother Michael Bascobert provided invaluable legal counsel and my brother Paul Bascobert helped with computer and electronic needs. Deanna Danner, Jackie Stavros, Jon Utech, Sue Hammond, Sandra Moncaldo, Kristin Mitchell, and Lisa Davidson read through various parts of my manuscripts, and provided a wealth of diverse suggestions. I also had wonderful conversations with my sisters-in-law Sharon Kelm, Kathy Kelm, Deanna Danner, Jane Kirk, and Julie Jiang, ruminating over a variety of book decisions and considerations.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">I also had three “angels” show up at just the right time during this process. I met Heather Therien as I was finishing the first draft, who agreed to read through it during her summer break. She is a brilliant and creative copy editor, who added value to the book well beyond grammar suggestions. I then happened to meet Kate Piersanti over the phone as I was finishing up the final draft, and she generously went through the entire manuscript and provided detailed design, editing, and layout suggestions. Jane Pinzauti came to the rescue one week before I printed the book, and created the most wonderful cover design. I am deeply appreciative of the talent and generosity of all three women, none of whom would accept much beyond a dinner for their incredible effort.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Then there is my personal support system. Jon, my husband of 15 years, could not have been more supportive. He watched our two children almost continuously towards the end, ate a lot more hotdogs for dinner than most, and was my sounding board and major advocate. I love him dearly.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">My parents and my husband’s parents have always been supportive. My mother and father watched the children for me on occasion, and were always interested in how my writing was going. My father-in-law came to visit during a deadline, and was considerate and understanding while I effectively ignored him the entire weekend.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">Finally, there are Cindy Mease and Linda Horn who are amateur photographers. I was hoping to use their inspiring pictures in my book but it did not work out. They were so considerate and understanding through the whole process, and I still hope to find a place for their work.</p>

    <p class="Normal _idGenParaOverride-1">I am so grateful for each one of you - thank you all.</p>

    <p class="quote _idGenParaOverride-1">Be like the bird that,<br />passing on her flight awhile on boughs too slight,<br />feels them give way beneath her,<br />and yet sings,<br />knowing that she hath wings.</p>
