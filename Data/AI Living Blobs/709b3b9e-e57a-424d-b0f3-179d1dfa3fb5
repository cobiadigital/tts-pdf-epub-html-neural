    <p class="quote">I am not only here to be, I am also here to become. ~Goethe</p>

    <p class="first">As I write this last page, I realize my life finally makes sense. I look back on my seemingly disparate experiences and see how each played a part in where I am today. I have found my passion and my calling in this work. I have finally found joy.</p>

    <p class="Normal">My undergraduate degree was a BS in mechanical engineering, but I was always fascinated with individual and group dynamics. I received an MBA from Case Western Reserve University with a concentration in organization behavior, where I was introduced to Appreciative Inquiry in a class taught by David Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker321"></a>. I was immediately enamored with the idea, and was able to apply it as a manager in the Leadership and Organization Change group for a large consulting firm.</p>

    <p class="Normal">I left the corporate world in 1999 to be home with my children, and began an earnest quest to use AI in my daily affairs. My life began to transform as I applied the principles, and I experienced happiness and joy beyond anything I believed was possible for me. I became passionate about sharing it with others and this first book was born.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Several years later I did a wildly successful national joy study using appreciative exercises that led to my second book: <span class="CharOverride-15">The Joy of Appreciative Living: Your 28-Day Plan to Greater Happiness through the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry</span>.</p>

    <p class="Normal">In 2013 when I thought I had it all figured out, I experienced medication-induced anhedonia (a type of depression) that took me into deep despair for almost a year. I was able to pull myself out with Appreciative Living, and am more of a believer than ever in the power of this work.</p>

    <p class="Normal">While my life is not perfect, I live with greater joy than I ever dreamed. And my greatest hope is that you will too.</p>
