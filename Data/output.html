['<speak><p>Every day we are confronted with questions that cry out for a decision. Some of the questions are relatively insignificant: What should I have for breakfast? Shall I read this news article or skip to the next? Others are more important: Should I take on that new project? Talk to my boss about a problem that has come up at work? Is it time for our family to start looking for a new house?</p><p>It is perfectly natural, and reasonable, to want to answer such questions as soon as possible. Why waste time being indecisive? Whether you’re trying to decide on what to wear or whether to take that new job offer, the clock is ticking. There’s often no "right" answer—or if there is one, who knows what it might be? And so, we figure, there’s no point overthinking it—might as well choose what feels right in the moment or, to put it another way, "go with your gut."</p><p>One can justify this approach by pointing out that a number of top business leaders are known for making critical decisions by relying on "great instincts"—or so the glowing profiles in the business press tell us regularly. The "gut" truly became hip after Malcolm Gladwell’s popular 2005 book, Blink, which told stories of split-second, instinctive decisions that turned out astonishingly well.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>But a growing body of research has concluded that our instincts—our natural tendencies to think or react in certain ways when faced with a decision—aren’t as trustworthy as we might believe. We’re subject to inherent biases, false confidence, irrational risk aversion, and any number of decision-making pitfalls. Katherine Milkman of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, who has researched and written extensively on decision-making, says: "The science simply doesn’t support the value of following your gut—in fact, it supports exactly the opposite approach to decision-making." The psychologist and decision-making expert Daniel Levitin concurs: If you make decisions based on instinct, he says, "your gut is going to be wrong more than it is right."</p><p>So what can we do about that? When it comes to important decisions, we can put less trust in feelings and more in evidence. We can seek input from outside sources and differing perspectives—to try to see past our own biases and limited views. We can generate more options to choose from when making a decision (which experts say is a key element in arriving at better decisions). We can also factor in our innate tendencies to be overly cautious or too focused on short-term benefits, and strive to make decisions that are bolder and more forward-looking.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>But we can’t do any of that unless we’re willing to think about—and ask questions about—the decisions we make, as we’re making them. In this section, we’ll look at why you should question your decisions (or at least some of them) and which questioning strategies seem to be most effective. We’ll consider how you can use self-questioning to make more balanced decisions as well as make more courageous ones to help overcome fear of failure. And we’ll see that asking the right questions can even help with the biggest decisions—such as figuring out where your passions lie, so that you can decide which goals and dreams to pursue.</p><p>As for the smaller decisions—choosing the right coat to wear or the best route to work this morning—not every choice made during the course of the day must be subject to rigorous questioning. People do, after all, have to get things done. Mike Whitaker, author of The Decision Makeover, advises that rather than spending time analyzing small decisions, "have fun with them." Use them as an opportunity to be spontaneous or creative. Ice cream for breakfast? Go with your gut.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>But the decisions that matter—in your business or your career, in personal relationships or financial investments, in the voting booth—are worthy of more thought. This brings us quickly to one of the problems of decision-making: Many of us don’t particularly like to think about difficult decisions. The process can be uncomfortable and unsettling.</p><p>Hard decisions demand that we make a choice in the midst of uncertainty; they force us to confront the unknown. Fortunately, the question is a tool designed for this precise situation. Questions enable us to "organize our thinking around what we don’t know," says Steve Quatrano of the Right Question Institute, an inquiry research group.</p><p>Think of your innate questioning skills as a flashlight and the decision ahead of you as a dark room. Each question illuminates a new area (and the better the question, the more light it casts). As we confront the various unknowns surrounding a tough decision, each question—What am I really trying to decide here? What’s most important? What critical information do I have and not have?—enables us to see a little more clearly, and helps us to step forward in the face of uncertainty.</p><break time="3s"/></speak>']
