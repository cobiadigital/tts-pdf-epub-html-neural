    <p class="chnum ParaOverride-1">EPILOGUE</p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-24"><span class="CharOverride-31">A Proposition….</span></p>

    <p class="first">Diving deep into the principles of Appreciative Inquiry has been an amazing professional and personal exploration. I have been thinking about, talking about, researching, and writing about the principles for almost two years. The book has emerged into something quite different than how it first began. My learning was exponential and the writing and rewriting was extensive. I feel I am finally beginning to get a sense of the whole of AI.</p>

    <p class="Normal">I realize now that this book came out of an implicit question I had: “What does it mean to apply AI in personal life?” As I look at the principles, I am in awe of the breadth and depth of the answers. Some concepts are broad and deep like those in the Constructionist Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker287"></a>, and some are narrow like those in the Simultaneity Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker288"></a>. Some are more conceptual, like those in the Anticipatory Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker289"></a>, while some are more practical, like in the Enactment Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker290"></a>. There are also overlaps in some of the concepts, such as those in the Constructionist and Positive Principles that tend to underlie the other principles.</p>

    <p class="Normal">As I sit back and reflect on the magnitude of concepts represented, I realize I’m intrigued now with a new set of questions. What might happen if we were to repackage the principles in a way that was more clear, concise, consistent, and complete? How would AI be advanced by a set of principles that were more easily grasped?</p>

    <p class="Normal">I think a simpler, more “user-friendly” version of the principles could propel AI into a whole new domain. I’m not talking about simplifying or re-wording the existing principles, but taking all the principles together as a whole and creating something new. A new metaphor<a id="_idIndexMarker291"></a>? A new image? What about a new set of 3-5 principles that more clearly and concisely encompasses all the concepts? It is exciting to think of the ways AI could be furthered by making the principles more accessible to all.</p>

    <p class="Normal">There is one additional construct I would include in this new package. I would describe it in current terminology as “The Self-Organizing Principle.” It would include relevant concepts from chaos theories and living systems theories on such things as emergent structures, instability and chaos, equilibrium, boundaries, and evolvement into higher orders. It would essentially describe the new thinking around how we change, evolve, grow and organize as living systems.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Perhaps repackaging of the principles could be a topic for the next significant AI gathering. Perhaps it will be the topic of my next book. I had better tell my husband to get ready to eat more hot dogs while I get to work.</p>
