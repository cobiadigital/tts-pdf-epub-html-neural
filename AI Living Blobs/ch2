    <p class="chnum">CHAPTER 2</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-15" class="chtitle"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"></a>The Poetic Principle</p>

    <p class="quote ParaOverride-13">The moment one gives close attention to <br />anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes <br />a mysterious, awesome, indescribably <br />magnificent world in itself.</p>

    <p class="quote ParaOverride-14"><span class="CharOverride-22">~ H</span><span class="CharOverride-19">ENRY</span><span class="CharOverride-22"> M</span><span class="CharOverride-19">ILLER</span></p>

    <p class="first">The Poetic Principle suggests that “pasts, presents, or futures are endless sources of learning, inspiration, or interpretation—precisely like, for example, the endless interpretive possibilities in a good piece of poetry or a biblical text.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-046">46</a></span></span> We can find whatever we want in a person or situation: good and bad, right and wrong, beautiful and ugly. What we choose to focus on creates our reality. The more attention we give to something, the more it expands as part of our experience.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-16" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"></a>Life Experience is Rich</p>

    <p class="quote">Reality leaves a lot to the imagination. ~John Lennon</p>

    <p class="first">The Poetic Principle suggests that no matter what we want to find in a situation, organization, or person, it is in there somewhere. Narrative therapists talk about the idea of lived experience being “rich.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-047-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-047">47</a></span></span> There are a limitless number of things we can notice in any moment, and our choice is fateful. It is the classic example of one thousand people witnessing an accident and finding one thousand different accounts of what happened. Each person is paying attention to something different—and they see it through their own lens of reality.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Appreciative Inquiry (AI) assumes that each person and “living system has many untapped and rich and inspiring accounts of the positive.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-048-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-048">48</a></span></span> For example, some people look at poor, starving people from third world countries and see hopelessness, poverty, and destitution. Mother Teresa, on the other hand, saw God<a id="_idIndexMarker147"></a> in these people.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-049-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-049">49</a></span></span> She was able to do more for them by seeing their strength and beauty than in focusing on the hopelessness of their situation.</p>

    <p class="Normal">When I walk into my workplace there are an infinite number of things on which I can focus my attention. I can notice characteristics of the room such as style, cleanliness, orderliness, and spaciousness. I can pay attention to the people and notice their appearance, actions, and expressions. I can focus on myself and reflect on my appearance, thoughts, and feelings. Every moment is full of things to pay attention to and what we choose to notice creates our experience.</p>

    <p class="Normal">When we come from a traditional belief that reality is something we observe rather than create, it can be hard to accept that we can find anything we want in a person or our self. There is always more present in the collective image of who we are that is endearing, positive and hopeful. It is sometimes more difficult to see these things in ourselves or others depending on how deeply we hold to our current beliefs. As we focus on the positive aspects we help bring them to life and shift our beliefs accordingly. We are rich in positive potential.</p>

    <p class="Normal">We have to realize again from the Constructionist Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker148"></a> chapter, that our truth<a id="_idIndexMarker149"></a> about reality is local, and not the only way to see it. There are an infinite number of things we can pay attention to in a given situation or individual, and our choice is fateful.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-17" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"></a>We Have Habits of Seeing</p>

    <p class="quote">It’s not “seeing is believing;” it’s “believing is seeing.” ~The Santa Clause II</p>

    <p class="first">We tend to notice the same things over and over in given situations. We have certain “habits” about how we look at what is happening. Senge<a id="_idIndexMarker150"></a>, Scharmer, Jaworski, and Flowers explain:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">With just the slightest pause, we can begin to appreciate the symphony of activities and experiences, past and present, that come together in each simple moment of awareness. Yet out of the symphony we typically hear only one or two notes. And these, almost always, are the ones most familiar to us.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-050-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-050">50</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Our choice about what to pay attention to is a relational decision that is a function of many factors. It includes the implicit questions we ask, such as, “what’s important to pay attention to here, what’s relevant, or what’s interesting to me?” These implicit questions are driven by such things as our collective beliefs, stories, norms, and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker151"></a>. Our focus is also a function of the others present in the moment and our relationships with them. We are influenced by the people with us who call our attention to certain aspects of a situation. We are also influenced by other “voices” in our heads from past experiences. These might be a supportive teacher’s voice as we decide to write a book, or a news anchor’s voice as we go to vote. Each of these voices will shift attention to different aspects of a situation.</p>

    <p class="Normal">We form patterns or automatic habits about what we notice as we continue to pay attention to similar things over time. This automatic thinking about where to focus goes on without much conscious attention from us, unless we choose to bring it more fully into our awareness. We compete with these existing voices and stories when we choose to notice something new or different.</p>

    <p class="Normal">A supposedly true short story came through my e-mail that illustrates how our underlying beliefs<a id="_idIndexMarker152"></a> and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker153"></a> determine what we notice in a situation. A mother was driving her 5-year old son to school. As they approached a stop-light, the woman in the convertible in front of them stood up and waved – totally naked. The mother gasped, not sure what to say to her son. The boy exclaimed, “Mommy, that lady is not wearing her seat belt!” The mother and son were clearly paying attention to different aspects of the situation based on their underlying beliefs<a id="_idIndexMarker154"></a> and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker155"></a>. The voice of her son caused the woman to shift her attention to something very different in the situation. Had the mother said something before the boy did about the woman’s appearance, the boy’s understanding of the situation would have shifted with his focus. This is an overt example of co-constructing, where what we choose to notice and then ultimately construct is influenced by others.</p>

    <p class="Normal">In Western culture there is high value placed on problem-solving and critical thinking, and many view the world through this lens. There is an underlying assumption that problems exist out there that will cause harm or even death if we do not fix them. If we operate from this assumption, then what we pay attention to in a given situation are problems, or what is wrong. The habit is strong since we believe our very survival depends on it. The more we believe in the “underlying problem” assumption, the more likely we are to be critical or problem-focused in a given situation.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Appreciative Inquiry operates from a different set of assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker156"></a>. If we operate from the assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker157"></a> of the Poetic Principle, that life is open to infinite interpretations and that what we focus on creates our reality, then it makes sense to focus on the most life-affirming aspects of a situation. This brings us to look for things we like in an experience or person: what has worked in the past, what we want in the future, and what strengths and assets are available to us. It is to assume that each situation contains tremendous positive potential if we choose to find it. This is a radical departure from the Western, problem-focused paradigm.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Shifting Beliefs</p>

    <p class="first">The implications of this principle are powerful. It may sound simple enough to look for the good, but shifting our automatic habits of seeing and challenging all those present and pre-existing voices and stories can be difficult. As we described earlier, our beliefs and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker158"></a> play an important role in keeping our lives manageable. It would be impossible for us to immediately throw out all our problem-focused beliefs and replace them with AI beliefs. The transition time in changing our underlying thinking provides a buffer for us in maintaining some continuity and stability in our lives. The more steeped in problem-solving we are, the longer it can take.</p>

    <p class="Normal">There are a variety of theories and techniques for shifting our underlying beliefs<a id="_idIndexMarker159"></a> and assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker160"></a>. Positive psychology spokesman Martin Seligman has a number of suggestions for creating more optimistic beliefs in his book <span class="CharOverride-15">Authentic Happiness</span>. These include disputing negative beliefs, and finding less destructive ways to see a situation.<span class="endnote-reference CharOverride-23"> </span><span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-051-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-051">51</a></span></span> AI suggests that the beliefs and stories which limit our perspective can shift indirectly as we begin to focus on what we want.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-18" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>Whatever We Focus on, Grows</p>

    <p class="quote">People become what they think about, most of the time. ~Earl Nightingale</p>

    <p class="first">A second assumption of the Poetic Principle is that whatever we pay attention to grows, or becomes a larger part of our experience. Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker161"></a> and Whitney<a id="_idIndexMarker162"></a> explain that “human systems grow in the direction of their deepest and most frequent inquiries.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-052">52</a></span></span> Mac Odell, a leading AI practitioner, puts it this way: “If you focus on problems, you find more problems. If you focus on successes, you find more successes.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-053">53</a></span></span> Again, this assumption suggests that we don’t just observe reality, but create it through our acts of observation. In this way, what we focus on “grows” as we continue to notice more and more of it, expanding it into more of our reality.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Focus is Fateful</p>

    <p class="first">Certain branches of quantum mechanics have been exploring the idea of how we create reality by what we pay attention to. Physicist John Archibald Wheeler is one proponent of a concept called the <span class="CharOverride-15">participative universe,</span><span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-054">54</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-15"> </span>which suggests that what we choose to notice in a situation becomes our reality and everything else goes by the proverbial wayside. Wheatley<a id="_idIndexMarker163"></a> explains:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">[The participative universe is]…a place where the act of looking for certain information evokes the information we went looking for—and simultaneously eliminates our opportunity to observe other information…we create not only the present with our observations, but the past as well. It is the existence of observers who notice what is going on that imparts reality to everything. When we choose to experiment for one aspect, we lose our ability to see any others. Every act of measurement loses more information than it gains, closing the box irretrievably and forever on other potentials.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-055">55</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">This is the quantum physics way of saying that we have an unlimited number of ways we can create our current reality, but our decision to select one creates it and eliminates all others.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-056-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-056">56</a></span></span> Our collective choice about what to observe is not a neutral event.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker164"></a> explains this in AI as “topic choice is fateful.” It speaks to this notion that what we choose to study or to notice in an organization creates that very thing. If we choose to study success we will not only find it, but more success will be generated. The same is true in our personal lives. <span class="CharOverride-15">What we choose to pay attention to becomes a greater part of our experience.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal">John Walter and Jane Peller state that, “Our belief is that whatever clients call their attention to begins to happen more often. This happens in both positive and negative ways.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-057">57</a></span></span> They go on to provide an example of how this works in parenting:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">We have all seen how parents who may be very vulnerable to the fear of their teens getting into drugs become hyper-vigilant for any signs of their teen becoming involved with drugs. Through the hyper-vigilance, both the parents’ attention and the teens’ attention are drawn to drugs. Soon, in many cases, the parent’s worst fear takes place. The opposite is also true. By shifting our attention and vigilance to what we want, the positive outcome we desire is more likely to happen.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-058-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-058">58</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">The implications of this are extensive. We are creating our experience in each moment by virtue of what we choose to pay attention to. The more attention we give something, the more it grows. This is why AI believes that problems are not the best place to focus. We are actually making them bigger with our attention.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Thinking Spirals</p>

    <p class="first">Minister Bill Turner coined the phrase “thoughts have babies” to capture the essence of the idea that what we focus on grows. This phrase describes the spiraling effect of our attention as we start down a trail of noticing what is or is not working. One thought leads to another which leads to another, and the next thing we know we have traveled far down a path that defines our truth<a id="_idIndexMarker165"></a> about a particular topic. We can spiral up or down or go in circles.</p>

    <p class="Normal">This happened to me recently after facilitating a large group AI session for a successful organization. I presented the exciting images of the future that came out of the data, only to be met with a response best characterized as flat. I had done this process four other times, all with incredible participant response and energy. The next day I began reflecting on what had gone wrong to try to understand what had happened (problem-focused thinking dies hard). I realized that the organization was doing so well, that the visions we created for the future were not very stimulating. People felt like they were already doing many of these great things, and were confused about what was a current strength or future possibility. Once I analyzed the flat-energy problem, I began to tear apart the rest of the meeting. I systematically critiqued any aspect of the presentation that fell short and looked for places to assign blame. Next thing I knew, I believed the meeting was a failure, and I as well for orchestrating it. Old feelings of inadequacy popped-up and I spent almost two days feeling disappointed. This is an embarrassingly good example of negative spiraling from problem focus. Had I stopped here, I would have carried a belief with me into the future that this meeting was a disaster. More importantly, I may have missed out on the inherent learning it contained.</p>

    <p class="Normal">I was so deep in the muck that it did not occur to me to apply the principles of AI until a few days later. One morning I decided to list all the good things that came out of the meeting and the entire process. The attendees were generally happy with the results and the head of the organization was very satisfied. I realized my expectations were much higher than the expectations of anyone else.</p>

    <p class="Normal">I then recalled a difficult past experience that was of tremendous value. I almost destroyed my college sorority when I became president by trying to implement big changes without group buy-in. I learned the importance of involvement and seeking input and was able to build the organization back up by the end of the semester. I looked at this learning and how it has served me over and over again, despite the pain involved.</p>

    <p class="Normal">I considered this recent meeting within the context of appreciating the inherent lessons and knew that I would be better from the experience. This feeling of gratitude allowed me to be open to learning in a way I could not when feeling down. I came to see that greater involvement of the members in the creation of the initial vision would have boosted the energy in this situation. I listed other positive aspects and learnings and was able to spiral back up and appreciate the meeting for the insight and value it provided.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Finding the Good</p>

    <p class="first">It is important to point out in this example that I did not ignore or gloss over the areas that fell short, or paint a perfect picture of the meeting. I looked at the meeting honestly with an appreciative eye, instead of a critical one. In this case it meant inquiring into it with a sincere and grateful intention to really learn from and discover something new from the experience. I sincerely wanted to know how to do it better the next time, and welcomed the opportunity to grow. This is a completely different focus than looking for mistakes and getting upset that I did something wrong. It is more than just semantics. It is a sincere intention to find what we want; to find something empowering and helpful in the situation.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Our feelings can provide guidance as to whether we are heading up or down the proverbial spiral. If we feel good, we’re on our way up the spiral. If we feel bad, there is a good chance we are focusing on something we do not want, like, or appreciate. Again, this does not mean ignoring what is going on in the moment. It means shifting our attention to find more of what we want in the negative situation. It often requires a shift to notice and appreciate the inherent learning that is always present.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Let us circle back to the question of reality. So, was it a good or bad meeting? Was I putting on rose-colored glasses or distorting reality when I shifted my focus? To find the answer, we must go back to the Constructionist Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker166"></a>. There is no “truth<a id="_idIndexMarker167"></a>” about what happened in that meeting, only my interpretation of it. Each person will have experienced it differently and have formed a different opinion about how good or bad it was. The point is not to debate the “truth” about the meeting. Weick suggests that instead we focus on effectiveness, ask reflective questions of what happened, and determine what actions might have served us better.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-059-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-059">59</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">The Poetic Principle is about shifting attention in the moment to what you want. This is at the heart of AI and what sets it apart from positive thinking. It is a sincere and continuous search for the best of what is present in each moment, person, and experience. It is not what we wish were there, but the good we can actually find.</p>

    <p class="Normal">As we briefly described in the previous section, a lot of our choices about what to focus on happen automatically. This was certainly the case for me as I immediately focused on where and how the meeting broke down. We can, however, learn to shift our automatic thinking to place attention on what we want instead of problems.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-19" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>Finding What We Want More of, Not Less</p>

    <p class="quote">I do not seek, I find. ~Pablo Picasso</p>

    <p class="first">The third assumption of the Poetic Principle is that we can be more deliberate in finding, and hence creating, what we want. AI is about the co-evolutionary search for the best in people, their organizations, and the relevant world around them.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-060-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-060">60</a></span></span> It is not about searching for people who are not at their worst, as silly as this may sound. We can only create what we want more of, not less of.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Think “To” Rather than Think “From”</p>

    <p class="first">Focusing our attention on what we do want will create more of it, while focusing on what we don’t want will create more of that as well. If we focus on how we “never have enough money,” what we create in our lives is “not enough money.” Psychiatrist Milton Erickson claimed it was not possible to create a mental image or think about not doing something.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-061-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-061">61</a></span></span> For example, if I tell you not to think about a pink flamingo, you will have already created an image of it as I speak. The more I tell you not to think about it, the more I call your attention to it. It is our attention to something that makes it part of our experience.</p>

    <p class="Normal">It would be much easier if I told you to think about a purple crocodile, instead of not thinking about a pink flamingo. Notice how much easier it is to not think about the pink flamingo when there is something else to focus on. The inherent assumption in this idea is that you know what you want. Many of us know we do not want pink flamingoes but don’t have a clear vision of what we truly desire. It can be difficult to determine what we do want when we have automatic habits of paying attention to problems, or what we don’t want.</p>

    <p class="ParaOverride-15"><span class="CharOverride-24">Walter and Peller describe this in discussing a drinking problem with a client:</span></p>

    <p class="blockquote">The more the conversation is drawn to talking of the problem, the more the client and therapist are thinking of and associating further about the problem… The more a conversation is focused on not-drinking as a problem or as a preference, the more both client and consultant are thinking of drinking…What makes more sense, both pragmatically and metaphorically, is to think of something else. What makes even more sense is to think of what we want to happen or what we want in our life rather than trying to stop thinking about or eradicating what we do not want.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-062-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-062">62</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Another way to think about this is that it is much more powerful to <span class="CharOverride-15">think to, </span>rather than<span class="CharOverride-15"> think from</span>. “Thinking to” involves creating images and ideas about what we want, and “thinking from” is looking at how we can eliminate or fix something we don’t want. “Thinking to” is a creative act and “thinking from” is destructive.</p>

    <p class="Normal">As we discussed above, it can be difficult to shift our automatic ways of seeing to focus on what we want. One way to do this is by asking different questions, which we will discuss at length in the chapter on the Simultaneity Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker168"></a>. A second way to do this is with a technique professor and consultant Gervase Bushe<a id="_idIndexMarker169"></a> calls “tracking and fanning.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-063-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-063">63</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="heading2">Tracking and Fanning</p>

    <p class="first">Tracking and fanning is a technique for finding what we want in a person or situation and then magnifying it. In his book <span class="CharOverride-15">Clear Leadership</span>, Bushe<a id="_idIndexMarker170"></a> describes tracking as, “the ability to see what we want more of as already being there.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-064-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-064">64</a></span></span> It is finding love in a person you dislike, or deeper love in someone you care about. It is seeing generosity in someone selfish, finding peace amidst chaos, and discovering joy in turbulent times. It requires a belief in the assumptions<a id="_idIndexMarker171"></a> of the Poetic Principle—that all is present in a person or situation—and looking for what we want brings it to life.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Bushe<a id="_idIndexMarker172"></a> tells an interesting story in his book about a team led by a man named Jack, who handled a difficult situation with an African warlord. The story nicely illustrates the use of tracking and fanning and his publisher, Davies-Black, kindly permitted it to be reprinted here:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">A team from Healthy World, a non-governmental organization, had entered the small, war-torn African country to get permission from the current ruler to allow them to begin inoculating children against diarrhea, one of the major causes of infant mortality. There were reports that government forces were killing women and children in outlying villages, and just before the audience with the ruler someone had put a videotape into Jack’s hands, showing a recent massacre. The irony of inoculating children who might then be gunned down was not lost on Jack, the team leader, and he decided to try and do something about it.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">When he was given an audience with the ruler, he explained their desire to inoculate the children and asked for permission to do so, which he was given. He then also asked the ruler if he would help to open the first clinic to begin “saving the children of your country.” The ruler agreed to do that. Then, in a risky move, Jack asked for a videotape machine and played the tape of the ruler’s troops massacring women and children. Nothing more was said except to thank the ruler for having given his permission to “save the children of your country.”</p>

    <p class="blockquote">A few days later when the outdoor clinic was set up and mothers were lined up with children to get the inoculations, the Healthy World staff put the syringe in the ruler’s hands and invited him to give the injections. As the long line of thankful mothers, joyful over the blessing they were receiving at the hand of their ruler, moved past, the Healthy World staff kept saying to him, “You are saving the children of your country. Now you really are the father of your nation.” The ruler so enjoyed himself he decided to cancel all his engagements and spent the next few weeks traveling with the clinic throughout the country, personally inoculating children and being reminded over and over that “now you really are the father of your nation.” The massacres stopped.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-065-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-065">65</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">As this story illustrates, when we begin to look for, or “track” the attribute we want, it begins to grow larger. At first, the attribute we want may be quite small, or even impossible to see. Bushe<a id="_idIndexMarker173"></a> says sometimes it requires a “leap of faith” to believe that it exists in the first place. In the story above, it took a leap of faith to find caring and compassion in the African ruler. For us, it might be noticing what’s right with our rude neighbor, or finding good in a person who burglarized our home. But if we believe it’s there, and keep looking, eventually we will find it. When we do, we can begin “fanning” like crazy.</p>

    <p class="Normal">“Fanning” is what Bushe<a id="_idIndexMarker174"></a> refers to as the process of magnifying what we want.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-066-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-066">66</a></span></span> It involves finding ways to appreciate and affirm the good, which makes it grow larger. It is a form of positive reinforcement as we notice, appreciate, and call attention to what we want in the moment. We are fanning when we offer praise for a job well done: to our children when they behave well, to a spouse who has been helpful, to ourselves when we have been kind and thoughtful. Fanning can also be done more formally by giving awards, sending gifts, or thank-you cards. By sincerely acknowledging and affirming whatever is wanted, we reinforce that behavior or attribute.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Tracking and Fanning Examples</p>

    <p class="first">Parents and teachers have been embracing this concept for some time. There are many books on positive reinforcement for finding what we want in our children and then encouraging that behavior. A story from <span class="CharOverride-15">The Right Questions</span> by Debbie Ford illustrates the use of tracking and fanning to deal with a common child behavior problem:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">…When Erin [Jonathan’s mother] arrived at Jonathan’s school one day, his teacher made an offhand remark about Jonathan’s habit of picking his nose. Erin was horrified…As she grew more preoccupied with her son’s bad habit, Erin seemed to lose sight of the bigger picture—that she was blessed with a healthy, funny, creative, and loving child. The more Erin reprimanded Jonathan for his actions, the more he acted out, sometimes picking his nose right in front of her just to gain attention.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Finally, when Erin realized she was just focusing on what was wrong with her son, she decided to give up trying to fix his behavior and instead focus her attention on all the things that were right about Jonathan. At bedtime after she read him his good-night story, Erin began stroking his head and telling him all the things she loved about him. Within a few days Jonathan had stopped acting out and instead seemed to be thriving in the presence of his mother’s approval.<span class="endnote-reference _idGenCharOverride-1"> </span><span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-067-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-067">67</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">This story illustrates how Erin was able to track more of the behavior she wanted in her son, and then fan it by talking about it with him at night. There were two parts to the success of this endeavor. The first was her sincere attention to and appreciation of the attributes she wanted to see, and the second was letting go of attention to what was not wanted. In the same book, Ford asks us to consider:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">What would happen if we listened to our neighbors as though they were the wisest people in the world? Would they show up any different than they do right now? What would be possible if we approached our partners as though their sole purpose was to bring us ecstasy and joy? What would we hear? What would we see? What would be possible? Looking for what’s right is a life-enhancing choice—a choice that promises peace, contentment, and fulfillment.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-068-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-068">68</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Consider how our lives would change if we began shifting our focus to the good.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Gratitude</p>

    <p class="first">Gratitude is another powerful way to help automatically re-direct our thinking to focus on what is right. The value of creating gratitude lists has been touted by a variety of people and institutions from Oprah Winfrey to various twelve-step programs. The essential idea is to spend time each day focusing attention on what we are grateful for. If we intentionally look for what is right or working in our lives, we will begin to create more of it.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Martin Seligman and others have documented the benefits of gratitude.<span class="CharOverride-25"><span id="endnote-069-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-069">69</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-24"> In one experiment, he had participants write three good things (big or small) that happened to them every day for one week, and list why they thought this good thing happened. He found that people were happier and less depressed immediately after doing the activity, and the positive effects were still being experienced three months later.</span><span class="CharOverride-25"><span id="endnote-070-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-070">70</a></span></span><span class="CharOverride-24"> </span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Gratitude is one of the most powerful ways to shift our thinking to focus on the good and create more of it in our lives. It helps train our minds to automatically notice what we want more of. When I first tried using a gratitude list many years ago, I had a hard time coming up with items. On particularly bad days, I reached for things to be grateful for, and listed things such as having toilet paper. I found that as I did the practice more, it became easier to come up with items. There was definitely a learning curve for me in learning to find the good, and it still continues.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Shifting our focus to tracking and fanning, “thinking to” what we want, or simply becoming aware of our gratitude are some of the most powerful ways to incrementally change our lives. It is like changing the course of a large ship by one degree. At first the trajectory does not look much different, but over time the gap widens and our lives end up in a completely different place.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-20" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>Developing an “Appreciative Eye”</p>

    <p class="quote">Thus the task is not so much to see what no one yet has seen, but to think what nobody yet has thought about that which everybody sees. ~Schopenhauer</p>

    <p class="first">Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker175"></a> explains that the appreciative eye “apprehends ‘what is’ rather than ‘what is not’ and...not only draws our eye toward life, but stirs our feelings, excites our curiosity and provides inspiration to the envisioning mind.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-071-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-071">71</a></span></span> He explains that affirmation is the first step in appreciation, and that as we appreciate we generate new ways of knowing.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Affirming Versus Appreciating</p>

    <p class="first">We describe or acknowledge what is already there when we affirm something. For example, an affirmation of a painting might be that it has excellent composition, or that we like it. We might affirm that we are good cooks, or that a friend has good taste in clothes. We get to appreciation by taking affirmation to the next level.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Appreciating goes beyond affirming by inquiring deeper into the positive aspects of something. <span class="CharOverride-15">Affirmation is descriptive and appreciation is creative</span>.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-072-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-072">72</a></span></span> The artisan reproduces, and the artist creates.<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-073-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-073">73</a></span></span> Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi said, “Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what no one else has thought.”</p>

    <p class="Normal">Appreciating is a more open and generative way of experiencing what is present. As we discussed earlier, life experience is rich. There are an infinite number of things we can notice and ways we can construct meaning in each moment. When we appreciate, we are inspired to inquire into what we like, and our curiosity causes us to notice new things. It is almost as if we call forth greater possibility by our belief and desire to see it so. We take a more active role in cognitively molding what we experience into new possibilities that transform how we think.</p>

    <p class="Normal">In the painting example, we might begin by affirming that it is well-composed, and then become curious about that and inquire more deeply into it. We might ponder the artist’s use of contrast, and the way it seems to make the light “dance” off the canvas. This might lead us to new thoughts about the use of contrast and movement in art, or any host of other creative thoughts about technique, style, or talent.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Physicist David Bohm<a id="_idIndexMarker176"></a> suggests that “creativity…is always founded on the sensitive perception of what is new and different from what is inferred from previous knowledge.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-074-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-074">74</a></span></span> In this way, appreciation is creative, as it represents new positive ways of thinking or perceiving. As we discussed in the Constructionist Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker177"></a>, we create our reality through our thoughts. As we discover new and more wonderful ways of knowing, we create more wonderful ways of being.</p>

    <p class="Normal">One of the essential components in developing an appreciative eye is the ability to focus so exclusively on the positive that the negative becomes irrelevant. It may sound like having an appreciative eye is like wearing rose-colored glasses, but there is a difference. Consider Cooperrider<a id="_idIndexMarker178"></a>’s account of Winston Churchill’s ability to see the positive:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Churchill’s impact and the guiding images he helped create were the result of his towering ability to cognitively dissociate all seeming impossibilities, deficiencies, and imperfections from a given situation and to see in his people and country that which had fundamental value and strength. His optimism, even in Britain’s darkest moment, came not from a Pollyanna-like sense that “everything is just fine” but from a conviction that was born from what he, like few others, could actually see in his country: “Doubtless it was there; but largely dormant until he had awoken it.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-075-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-075">75</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">Wearing rose-colored glasses is analogous to ignoring negative aspects or pretending they don’t exist. The Appreciative eye sees and believes in the positive side so strongly, it overshadows the negative elements.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Our Senses are Socially Conditioned</p>

    <p class="Normal">Social conditioning plays an active role in determining what we consider to be the positive and negative elements. I remember being in Australia and eating the popular food “vegemite” for the first time. I did not like the taste at all, and asked my Australian friend if it was really as popular as I had heard. She responded that it was, and asked if that awful-tasting peanut butter was really as popular in the US as we claimed. We had a laugh as we realized how taste was socially-conditioned. Our other senses are socially-conditioned as well. What we learn to find tasteful, pleasant, and beautiful is socially constructed.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Barry Kaufman describes a poem he read about gnarled, bent trees that had been “beaten into submission” by the wind at the ocean’s edge. He went to the same place with an appreciative eye, and came to a new and beautiful understanding of how miraculous the trees were in adapting and flowing with the force of the wind. He explains that “what some might depict as a struggle is actually the silent inner dance of a tree moving synergistically with the wind in a demonstration of perfect harmony and suitability.”<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-076-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-076">76</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="Normal">One of the best ways we can learn to enjoy and appreciate new things is through the eyes of another. People who love music, opera, the subway, fast food, old cars, or rap music can show us what they appreciate, and we can learn through them if we are open to new ways of knowing. We are continuously in conversations with others, which provide a wonderful way for us to continue to expand our notions of what is pleasant, wonderous, and beautiful. The following paraphrased story by Roger Dean Kiser, Sr. illustrates this idea further:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">Once upon a time there was a little orphan boy who wanted to fly and a little crippled boy who wished he could walk and run. The crippled boy’s father took him to the park, and the two boys met. The orphan boy asked the other if he had ever wanted to fly like a bird. “No,” said the boy who could not walk or run. “But I have wondered what it would be like to walk and run like other boys and girls.”</p>

    <p class="blockquote">The two boys played together for hours. The orphan boy said to the other, “I wish there was something I could do to make you walk and run like other little boys and girls, but I can’t. But there is something I can do for you. Slide up onto my back.”</p>

    <p class="blockquote">And so, the little boy slid up on his friend’s back. Then the orphan boy began to run across the grass. Faster and harder he ran across the park. Soon the wind whistled across the two little boys faces.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">The little boy’s father began to cry as he watched his beautiful little crippled son flapping his arms up and down in the wind, all the while yelling at the top of his voice, “I’m flying Daddy, I’m flying!<span class="CharOverride-14"><span id="endnote-077-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="endnotes.xhtml#endnote-077">77</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="first">Each of these boys was able to experience life through the eyes of the other, and enjoy a realm of life that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. Some of the greatest moments can be found in tapping into the joy experienced by another. If you want to watch someone come alive, inquire deeply into something she is excited about, and earnestly try to experience through her senses. Put yourself in her place and inquire into her experience until you begin to feel some of the same excitement. It’s a great way to help develop an appreciative eye, and to connect more deeply with another.</p>

    <p class="Normal">There are aspects in every moment and person to appreciate, and a large part of our ability to do this is cognitive. Even though we experience through our senses, our sensorial experience is formed by the meaning we attach and where we choose to focus. When we recognize that the things we enjoy and appreciate are another form of social construction, we can deliberately look for new ways of seeing and appreciating.</p>

    <p class="Normal">The essence of the appreciative eye is inhabiting a spirit of curiosity and openness to more positive ways of sensing and knowing. Just like good wine, good food, and good music, what we have come to like in people is socially constructed. When we open ourselves to new understandings, we can re-construct our images in ways that are more reflective of what we want to experience. This applies to people, present experiences, past memories and future images. In the Simultaneity Principle<a id="_idIndexMarker179"></a> chapter we’ll further explore what it means to live in this spirit of wonder.</p>

    <p id="_idParaDest-21" class="heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a>Final Thoughts</p>

    <p class="first">The Poetic Principle suggests that people and life experience are rich with positive potential. We have creative license to poetically describe and construct each experience with others any way we desire. The more we give attention to something, whether we want it or not, the more it grows. Affirmations are one way to acknowledge the good, but we can take affirming one step further by appreciating. We can develop an “appreciative eye” by inhabiting a spirit of openness and curiosity in our lives, which creates new and more positive ways of knowing.</p>

    <p class="Normal">Computer giant Microsoft asks, “Where do you want to go today?”™ The Internet, like life experience, lies at our fingertips before us, rich with potential, all things present. Our choice about what to enter in the address field creates our internet experience. Our choice about what to focus on in each moment creates our life experience.<a id="_idIndexMarker180"></a></p>
