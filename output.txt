['<speak><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Exercises</p><p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</p><p> ~ ARISTOTLE</p><p>In the previous chapter I explained how the AIA process helps us use Appreciative Inquiry (AI) in our daily interactions. In this chapter I present core exercises that help shift our automatic habits of thought and action to be consistent with the AI principles. These simple exercises embody the concepts of AI, and can be done in as little as 5-15 minutes a day. That’s not much to invest in creating the life of your dreams.</p><p>The purpose of these exercises is to help you automatically notice more of the good and deliberately create more of what you want in your life. They help you find the silver lining and see the glass "half-full." At first you may not observe much difference, since the changes in your thinking will be slow and gradual. Over time you will begin to notice subtle changes, and will realize that your life seems easier, happier, and more fulfilling.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>There is also a learning curve with these exercises. You will have to learn new ways of thinking and perceiving that may at first conflict with current beliefs and habits. For example, it may be difficult to find anything good in a difficult situation. It will get easier the more you practice.</p><p>There was a "tipping point" that occurred for me after some period of time in practicing these exercises. I don’t know this will be true for others, but there came a time where I noticed that my happiness seemed to begin building at a much greater rate. I suspect it had to do with finally learning how to grow and become stronger from negative experiences rather than just managing or getting through them. This happened as a by-product of learning to see the good. I think it was building the trait that Fredrickson refers to as "resilience." I was not resilient when I first began. My goal was to survive bad experiences at worst, and manage them well at best. Learning to be happy and grow from difficult times seemed to be the turning point for me in really living from a place a joy.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Most of these exercises are deceivingly simple and short. Most can be done in 15 minutes or less, though they may take a bit longer the first few times you do them. The idea is to gradually transform your thinking habits and integrate new ways of being. Slow and steady change is sustainable change. I invite you to just try one of the exercises for a few weeks and see what happens.</p><p>Where Do I Begin?</p><p>A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step. ~Lao Tzu</p><p>There are as many ways to begin as there are people reading this, and you can literally do the exercises in any order or frequency that works for you. The exercises are grouped by the three steps of Appreciating, Imagining, and Acting. There are ten exercises altogether.</p><p>The exercises were designed to be worked at any level. For example, there is an exercise called "Envisioning the Ideal" where you create an image of your desired future. You can use this exercise to create an image of a wonderful dinner you want to prepare that evening, or to create a complete image of your ideal life. You might spend 5 minutes creating the mental picture, or 55. You can use this exercise daily to create quick ideal images, or yearly to create your personal life vision. The exercises were designed to allow for as much flexibility as possible.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>The good news with this design is that you can create a custom solution that works uniquely for you. The tradeoff is that there is not much structure. One way to get started is to simply try each of the ten exercises. There are only ten, and if you do one each day, you will have tried them all in less than two weeks. At that point you will be familiar with the exercises and can find a way to use them that works for you. I typically do about 15 minutes a day of exercises, and rarely more than 30. I have to honestly say there are some days I don’t do any. I also meditate/pray for at least 15 minutes each morning, which seems to center me and clear my thinking in ways that are hard to explain. Here are a few suggestions and considerations in getting started.</p><p>I would begin with the "Gratitude" exercise #1, and do that every day. It takes less than a minute and can really help shift thinking to notice the positive. When you feel ready to take on more, I would then add one new exercise in addition to gratitude, which can both typically be done in 15 minutes or less. You can rotate through the exercises and do a different one each day to get familiar with each activity. Then I would suggest you simply pick an exercise that you are attracted to each day.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>A second approach is to create deliberate, focused change. This is done by staying with the same exercise, category of exercises, or topic for a period of time. For example, if you would really like to shift your thinking to see the good, you may do the appreciating exercises every day for a month or more. If you are dealing with a really difficult problem, you may want to work through each exercise in order, using the problem area as your topic for the exercise.</p><p>A third approach is to create periodic practices. For example, you might do an annual personal plan, where you do exercises #1, 2, 6, and 8 from the perspective of your life the previous year and what you want in the next. You could then design regular monthly exercises to help align your thinking and actions to your vision.</p><p>A final approach is to simply pick any exercise and get started. The important thing is just to try something. The only way to shift thinking is through experience, and simply reading about the principles is not enough to make change in our lives.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>I find that I need to do the practices regularly to keep the appreciative mind-set. Our culture is fairly negative and problem focused, and I realize I’m influenced more easily than I care to admit. I still experience ups and downs, but the ups are longer and higher, and the downs are fewer, shorter, and less painful.</p><p>I hope you find these exercises helpful, and if you want a complete program for changing your life for the better, check out my second book on "The Joy of Appreciative Living: Your 28-Day Plan to Greater Happiness Using the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry.

Do this once a day in the morning or evening, and pick something different each time.</p><p>Variation: List a person or situation at the top of several pages, and write one daily gratitude for each one. Topics might include your family, your job, specific people in your life, a challenging situation, or your home. This is also a good way to begin slowly shifting your thoughts about a negative person or experience.</p><p>Examples: If you are experiencing health problems, keep a page for specifically listing all the positive aspects of your current health. If you want a closer relationship with a co-worker, list him or her at the top of one of your pages.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Considerations: If you find it difficult to list things at first, stay with it. It takes time to shift our automatic habits to notice what is good. I remember days in the beginning where I stretched to come up with things like having enough toothpaste. If you are having trouble listing gratitudes for a difficult relationship or situation, try one of the other exercises first, such as "Reframing" or "Shifting Focus."</p><p>Refer to: The Poetic Principle: "Finding What We Want More of, Not Less" (pp. 40-47.) The Positive Principle: "It’s Good to Feel Good" (pp. 97-105.)</p><p>Exercise 2: Positive Core</p><p>Primary Purpose: Find the good in yourself or someone else</p><p>Time: 5-10 minutes, daily or as-needed</p><p>Activity: Inquire into the positive core of yourself, someone you are close to, or a person in your life with whom you would like a better relationship. List every strength, positive attribute, potential, or good characteristic you can think of. Think of others who like this person (or you) and the qualities you imagine they see. Spend 5-10 minutes writing every positive attribute you can think of. It’s important you get to the point of feeling positive emotion or the exercise won’t work.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Examples: I did this for my two children, husband, and myself each day for several weeks. I spent 5 minutes on each one of us, and I felt incredible closeness and love during that time. I find that the good thoughts and feelings subside a bit (but they don’t disappear) if I don’t make time to intentionally focus on them. I also found it was difficult to write about myself at first, but found this to be as important to the success of the process as finding the good in the others.</p><p>Variations: Do this exercise mentally when you are with the person. Take a moment to really look for as many good traits as you can find. You don’t need to say anything to him or her, but you can if you feel inclined. Notice how you feel as you do this, and if there is a shift in your relationship during this time.</p><p>Considerations: If you are doing this exercise with a person you are having a difficult relationship with, and can’t get to a place of feeling positive, try doing the "Shifting Focus" or "Reframing" exercises first.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Refer To: The Poetic Principle: "Whatever We Focus On, Grows" (pp. 35-40,) The Positive Principle: "Finding the Positive Core" (pp. 105-109.)</p><p>Exercise 3: Reframing</p><p>Primary Purpose: Shift perception about a negative situation</p><p>Time: 15-20 minutes, as-needed.</p><p>Activity: Think about a current difficult situation and try to open yourself to a new perspective or way of perceiving it. Reflect on the following questions and answer the ones that seem relevant:</p><p>How would the following people view my situation—a child, a starving person, a true friend, a homeless person, or someone with a terminal illness?</p><p>How will this issue impact my life ten years from now?</p><p>What is good about this situation, or what can I appreciate?</p><p>What do I really want in this situation? Why?</p><p>What am I focusing on, and how can I shift my focus to notice what I want?</p><p>What do I believe is realistically possible here? How can I expand this belief to broaden the range of possible outcomes?</p></speak>', '<speak><p>What learning is available, and how can I be open to it?</p><p>What one small thing can I do to make this situation just a bit easier or better?</p><p>Examples: In the heat of the moment, I believe it is important to honor whatever feelings are showing up – negative or otherwise. In the beginning, I had to deliberately reflect on these questions later, after I "calmed-down." A few of these questions have now become automatic for me, and I will often mentally think through them during a difficult situation. This helps reduce my negative reaction, and helps me think more clearly and productively in the moment.</p><p>Variation: Add your own questions to this list. Reflect on the AIA process in chapter 7 and list questions that would help you get back or stay on-track.</p><p>Considerations: It is ideally best to begin this exercise from a place of feeling good, but this is not always practical—especially in the heat of the moment. The better you feel when doing this, the better your ideas and insights will be.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Refer to: The Simultaneity Principle (pp. 53-70.)</p><p>Exercise 4: Shifting Focus</p><p>Primary Purpose: Shift attention to what you want</p><p>Time: 20-30 minutes the first day, then 5 minutes daily</p><p>Activity: Pick a person or area of your life where you are experiencing difficulty. We grow in the direction of what we persistently ask questions about, and this exercise helps us create more effective questions.</p><p>1. List what you don’t like or want.</p><p>I hate doing laundry.</p><p>Joe is stingy and I don’t like going out with him.</p><p>2. Determine what it is you really do want in this situation.</p><p>I want a pleasant laundry experience.</p><p>I want to enjoy my time out with Joe.</p><p>3. Create questions that help you look for and create more of what you want. For example:</p><p>Laundry:</p><p>What small change can I make today that will make the laundry more pleasant?</p><p>What do I enjoy or like doing, and is there any way to incorporate some aspect of this into my laundry activity?</p></speak>', '<speak><p>What strengths do I have that I can leverage in doing the laundry?</p><p>What best practices are out there for doing laundry?</p><p>Joe:</p><p>What do I enjoy most about going out with Joe?</p><p>What are Joe’s greatest strengths and gifts?</p><p>What do I appreciate most about Joe?</p><p>What change can I make, no matter how small, that will help me enjoy my time more with Joe?</p><p>4. Pick at least one new question from step 3 to ask each day, or each time the situation arises, and give the answer serious consideration. Your behavior may not change at first, but your thoughts will be shifting. Your behavior should eventually shift in response to your focus on what you want, as long as you sincerely keep asking and answering the new question.</p><p>Variation: List the biggest obstacles you believe are in your way of what you want. These are your underlying limiting assumptions. For example, "Laundry is a boring, monotonous task that I have to do every week." Challenge at least one limiting assumption in your new question. For example:</p></speak>', '<speak><p>What could I try with my laundry chore this week that would make it more interesting and enjoyable?</p><p>How can I go more than a week without doing laundry? What if I bought more clothes? What if I did it every day?</p><p>Do I have to do all my laundry? Could someone else do some or all of it? How else could I get clean clothes? Could I barter with someone?</p><p>Considerations: You can make this exercise more powerful by doing one of the Imagining exercises along with it. When you decide what you want in step 2, slip in one of the imagining exercises to create your ideal image of what you want. Then go on to step 3 of creating the questions. This will help you create your ideal future image first, and your new questions will become more focused and effective.</p><p>Refer to: The Simultaneity Principle: "We Live in the World Our Questions Create" (pp. 54-57,) "Change Begins the Moment We Question" (pp. 57-59,) and "The Unconditional Positive Question" (pp. 59-66.)</p><p>Imagining Exercises</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Exercise 5: Gaining Clarity</p><p>Get clear about what you want.</p><p>Exercise 6: Envisioning the Ideal</p><p>Create an ideal future image.</p><p>Exercise 7: Surfacing Assumptions</p><p>Enhance vision and success with change.</p><p>Exercise 5: Gaining Clarity</p><p>Primary Purpose: Get clear about what you want</p><p>Time: 5-10 minutes, daily (longer if you add the third column)</p><p>Activity: Think about your day today and list the major activities on the left side of a piece of paper or computer screen. On the right side, list the 2-3 things you want most from each event. It might be a certain feeling, outcome, learning, or experience. This helps us get clear about what we want, which allows us to be more deliberate in our interactions throughout the day.</p><p>Examples: I typically list anywhere from 5-10 major activities on the left, depending on the day. If one activity is driving the children around, I might list on the right that I want to have a pleasant, safe trip and arrive on time. If I am having lunch with a customer, I might list enjoying myself and building a strong relationship.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Variations: Every now and then, go through your day and add a third column listing why you want each thing you do. This is a powerful way to surface assumptions, reduce unhelpful influences from others, and improve your success in creating what you want. It may seem that the reasons are "obvious," but that is the nature of our assumptions. They are assumptions for the simple reason we never question them. For example, I want a pleasant car environment as I drive my children around. Upon further introspection, I realized that what was pleasant for me was not necessarily pleasant for my 4 and 6-year old. Their ideal trip would include laughing and making gross noises the whole way. This realization allowed us to develop a workable solution by including a designated period of "silly time" during the otherwise peaceful ride.</p><p>Considerations: This is one of the few exercises that I continue to do everyday. I am now to the point that I often pause before important activities or conversations to reflect momentarily on what I want most out of the exchange. I find it to be one of the most powerful tools in helping me create what I want.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Refer to: The Anticipatory Principle: "Vision Before Decision" (pp. 82-85,) and "We Conceive What We Believe" (pp. 85-89.)</p><p>Exercise 6: Envisioning the Ideal</p><p>Primary Purpose: Create an ideal future image</p><p>Time: 15-30 minutes. Do as needed.</p><p>Activity: Select something you want to happen in the future. It might be living the life of your dreams, working in a career you love, or having a wonderful relationship with your teenager.</p><p>1. Begin by getting yourself to a place of feeling good in whatever way works for you. It might be listening to music, looking through a photo album, or doing a short version of the positive core exercise. Once you feel good, continue to the next step.</p><p>2. Pretend I waved a magic wand, and your ideal _______ (life, career, relationship, etc.) came true in this moment. Write or type every aspect you can think of in this ideal situation. List your thoughts as they stream through your mind, and pretend everything is possible. Let your deepest hopes and desires come forth and dream big about the perfect life, a passionate career, or an incredible relationship with your teenager. Everything is possible. Pretend it is really happening now, and write in present tense (i.e., "I am happy," not "I will be happy.") Use the following questions to help guide your thinking.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>What is happening in this ideal situation or relationship?</p><p>How are you feeling?</p><p>What is the best part of all this?</p><p>How does your day go differently now?</p><p>What are you doing that’s new?</p><p>Who will be the first to notice and what will they say?</p><p>Examples: I do this every so often to create an image of my ideal life. I create a running monologue of every aspect of a wonderful life I can imagine. I often begin by reviewing previous visions to get to a place of feeling good. I start with a blank piece of paper each time and create my vision anew. I find that certain things become more and less important at different times, and I want a vision that reflects what is most important to me right now.</p><p>Variations: Create a picture collage of your ideal image. Use magazine cut-outs, clip art, internet pictures, photos, or whatever works to remind you of your ideal. Add key words or phrases. Post it somewhere you can view it regularly.</p><p>Considerations: We cannon change other people or external situations, so focus your vision on you and the experience and feelings you most want to experience. We don’t need others to change for us to be happy, even though we sometimes believe this. It’s a good assumption to investigate. (See Exercise 7)</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Refer to: The Anticipatory Principle: "Positive Images Create Positive Futures" (pp. 72-77,) and "The Power of Vision" (pp. 77-81.)</p><p>Exercise 7: Surfacing Assumptions</p><p>Primary Purpose: Enhance vision and success with change</p><p>Time: 10-15 minutes. Do as needed.</p><p>Activity: Think about something you really want in your life.</p><p>1. Create a brief statement describing what you want. Be sure it is not a statement of what you don’t want. For example, use "I want good health" instead of, "I don’t want to be sick." Here are some examples:</p><p>I want a sports car.</p><p>I want to be physically fit.</p><p>I want a loving relationship with my mother-in-law.</p><p>2. Create a running monologue of why you want this and keep asking why. List every reason you can think of. This exercise will help surface your underlying assumptions about why you desire this, which helps you see where you might need to alter or refine your vision. If you feel you are not getting to a deep enough level as you write, try answering the question "why" at least five consecutive times. For example, "I want a sports car because they are fun to drive. I want to have fun driving because I want to enjoy my life more in general. I want to enjoy my life more in general because I feel like I work all the time. I feel like I work all the time because…"</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Example: Here’s an example for wanting to be physically fit: I want to be physically fit because research shows I will live longer and have more energy. I want to live longer because I want to be healthy enough to be around and enjoy my grandchildren and great grandchildren. I want to have more energy to really enjoy my life and feel good throughout the day. I want to feel good in my clothes and be able to play golf without being sore the next day. I want to have more energy to get more done at night. If I got more done at night I would have more time in the evening to relax or perhaps take that painting class I’ve been wanting to take…(keep going)</p><p>Variation: You can add a third step to this process by listing all the reasons you believe you will get whatever it is you want. This helps surface deeper assumptions about what you deserve, what is possible, and so forth. Here is an example for wanting to be physically fit: "I will become physically fit because it is important to me, and I am making a solid commitment to myself to do this." (At this point an assumption surfaces that I don’t always follow through on my commitments. So, I search within for an honest belief of how I can be successful.) "I am disciplined and follow-through when I have a written plan, so I will create a plan that will insure my success. I was able to keep fit several years ago when…" (Keep going.)</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Considerations: This is a powerful exercise for surfacing hidden beliefs or thinking that may be getting in the way of success. It also helps you realize that what you want most when you dig underneath surface material desires, is a positive feeling of love, happiness, excitement, fun, or other positive emotion.</p><p>Refer to: The Anticipatory Principle: "Creating Powerful Images (pp. 77-79,) and "Vision Before Decision" (pp. 82-85.) The Free Choice Principle: "The Freedom of Inner Clarity" (pp. 128-129.) The Awareness Principle: "Surfacing Assumptions" (pp. 132-133.)</p><p>Acting Exercises</p><p>Exercise 8: Enacting</p><p>Begin making change.</p><p>Exercise 9: Acknowledging the Good</p><p>Build positive feelings in a relationship.</p><p>Exercise 10: Developing Conversational Awareness</p><p>Become more intentional in conversations.</p><p>Exercise 8: Enacting</p><p>Primary Purpose: Begin making change</p><p>Time: 5-10 minutes, daily.</p><p>Activity: First create an ideal image of what you want with either the "Envisioning the Ideal" exercise or, "Surfacing Assumptions" exercise. Using that ideal image:</p></speak>', '<speak><p>1. Answer this question: "As I step back and reflect on what I really want and where I am today, what do I see as one of the most significant changes I could make that would help me get what I want? What one change would have the greatest impact in helping me achieve what I really desire?"</p><p>2. Now ask, "What one small change could I make now, no matter how small, that would align with this high-impact change?" The change does not have to be a physical action, and can be a shift in thinking or attitude.</p><p>3. Just try it. Do this one small thing today that will move you in the direction of what you want.</p><p>4. Keep doing your small change and modify it if necessary until you find a way it works for you. When the change feels comfortable, or becomes a habit, consider coming back to this exercise and making another small change.</p><p>Example: I made a variety of small changes over the last several years in how I care for our home that have had a big impact. Our home is now relatively organized, de-cluttered, and cleaner than ever before. I did this by gradually introducing 15 minute activities suggested by the "FLY Lady," some of which became regular habits. (Visit her free website at www.flylady.net.)</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Variation: Consider doing this exercise with a friend. Discuss ways to support each other in making the change and sticking with it. You don’t need to work on the same thing, but you can if you like.</p><p>Considerations: If you find you are having trouble making the new change or sticking with it, try doing the "Shifting Focus" exercise with your area of difficulty.</p><p>Refer to: The Anticipatory Principle: "Big Change Begins Small" (pp. 89-95.) The Enactment Principle (pp. 122-126.)</p><p>Exercise 9: Acknowledging the Good</p><p>Primary Purpose: Build positive feelings in a relationship</p><p>Time: 5-10 minutes, as-needed.</p><p>Activity: Make a point to tell someone today what you appreciate about him. The compliment must be sincere, and will have the greatest effect if it is specific. For example, it is better to tell John you appreciate the level of detail he provided in his last report, rather than telling him he did a good job. If appropriate, give the compliment in front of others, but be sensitive to any possibility of embarrassment.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Examples: This exercise can be as simple as telling your friend that you appreciate the way she calls to check on you, or telling the receptionist that he handled your call very professionally. It can be as extensive as thanking your parents for specific ways they have helped you throughout your life, or telling your child what you love most about her in great depth. Again, the compliment must be sincere and should be specific.</p><p>Variations: You can write a letter instead of telling the person, or leave a little note on the mirror, desk, or other place where the person will see it. This can be an especially powerful exercise to help a difficult relationship.</p><p>Considerations: This is a nice follow-up activity to the gratitude journal. We come to really appreciate others as we do a gratitude list on them, and it adds to the positive momentum in our relationship when we tell them.</p><p>Refer to: The Constructionist Principle: "We are Deeply Inter-Connected" (pp. 22-26.) The Poetic Principle: "Tracking and Fanning" (pp. 42-46.) The Wholeness Principle (pp. 114-121.)</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Exercise 10: Developing Conversational Awareness</p><p>Primary Purpose: Become more intentional in conversations</p><p>Time: 10-15 minutes, do anytime.</p><p>Activity: Select a conversation you will be having today with another person.</p><p>1. Be aware during that conversation of the following:</p><p>Try to be aware of how you are a creating a new reality with this other person as you both speak. You could talk about anything, and your choice about what to discuss, what it means, and whether it is good or bad is all being subjectively decided in the moment. You are creating your experience of reality together.</p><p>Make a point to reflect when you feel positive emotion during the conversation: \n\n      <ul>\n<p>Notice what you are talking or thinking about during those times.</p>hr\n<p>Notice what the other person is saying or doing</p>hr\n<p>Notice the words or metaphors being used.</p>hr\n<p>Study every aspect of this part of the conversation to try and understand what facilitates positive constructions.</p>hr\n</ul></p></speak>', '<speak><p>Notice what you are talking or thinking about during those times.</p><p>Notice what the other person is saying or doing</p><p>Notice the words or metaphors being used.</p><p>Study every aspect of this part of the conversation to try and understand what facilitates positive constructions.</p><p>Pay attention to your discussions about future events and notice the images you build in your mind. Realize that you are creating the future as you speak.</p><p>2. Take a few minutes after the conversation to reflect:</p><p>What was the reality you created together? What other realities were also possible?</p><p>What kind of future realities did you create? Do you see the similarity in what you think and say about the future and the actual future you experience?</p><p>What were the factors that contributed to positive constructions in your conversation? What kinds of things did you talk about that felt good? How can you do more of that in future conversations?</p><p>How have you changed from this conversation? There is now something different about what you believe or think, or something has been reinforced. Notice how conversations change us in some way.</p></speak>', '<speak><p>Examples: This exercise really hit me hard when I first did it. I happened to try it with a friend who was going on about her cousin, and I became brutally aware of my role in helping her sustain and even build this negative construction. I thought I was being supportive in the past by being a good listener, but realized I was instead moving her into a more negative experience with her cousin by giving it even more attention.</p><p>Variations: Try this exercise with your internal dialogue. We are continually having conversations with ourselves and bringing in the voices of others. Spend a few minutes thinking about something you have coming up, or a situation you are experiencing. Pause and reflect on your internal thinking and answer the same questions above for your internal dialogue. Pay special attention to the words you use with yourself.</p><p>Considerations: This is an advanced exercise, but learning to be more deliberate in conversations is one of the most powerful tools available for creating what we want in our lives. I would suggest reading the sections referred to below to really be able to understand and do this exercise.</p><p>Refer To: The Constructionist Principle: "Reality is Co-Created" (pp. 11-14.)
