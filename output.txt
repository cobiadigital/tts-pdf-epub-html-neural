At the time of my diagnosis in the mid1980s, however, ADD diagnoses were much less common.  With symptoms said to include irritability, unpredictability  and impulsivity, disorganization, and forgetfulness, ADD  became both a curse and a blessing for my suburban middle-class family (Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 2005).1 As a curse, my  diagnosis corroborated feedback from teachers and family  friends that my "lack of motivation" and "lack of self-control" were genetically inherited traits that were not going to  disappear any time soon.2 Yet, as a blessing, my diagnosis  enabled my parents to treat my behavioral patterns as signs  of a biochemical imbalance, enabling my early "deficits" to  be understood as objects of institutional, interpersonal, and  pharmacological intervention. Through the identification of  ADD as a learning disability that could be managed with  proper medical and behavioral techniques, my unique disposition could now be accounted for in relation to a malleable network of ideals, norms, and targets, offering my  parents hope that I could become "high functioning" within  their increasingly anxious and high-stakes middle-class culture. This was a culture guided by dreams of entryway into  Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) during elementary  and secondary education and, ultimately, acceptance into a  prestigious institution of higher education upon the completion of high school. </p><p>Today, as an associate professor at what some might  consider a "prestigious" private university, it appears my  parents’ wishes have come true.

When  interacting with me today, no one knows that at age 10, I  repeated fourth grade or that from seventh to eighth grade  I attended Thorton Academy, a private school dedicated  to "bright children who learned differently". No one  knows that when I returned to public school at the start of  ninth grade I was expelled after only one semester, or that  for the remainder of high school I was "home-schooled"  in conjunction with an institution that taught me very little.

Hanan1 Abstract This essay (re)presents my own experiences living with attention deficit disorder (ADD) as a child and adult to provide a  radically historical, contextual, and critical autoethnographic conceptualization of this "learning disability." Specifically, by  building upon Ragan Fox’s "auto-archeological" method, a critical perspective that "unite[s] autoethnography and Foucault’s  theories of discourse," I draw upon institutional artifacts, psychiatric diagnoses, and interviews with close family members  to show that ADD is a "technology of the self" that economizes the body in accordance with a distinctly neoliberal  temporality. This temporalizing process, I show, is reinforced by a range of other neoliberal technologies of selfhood and  ultimately cultivates the very "deficit framework" that ADD diagnoses are aimed at healing. The conclusion questions the  legitimacy of ADD outside of the various technological interfaces that make the disability visible as a public problem and  considers the intimate connections between neoliberalism, ableism, and the contemporary university. </p><p>Keywords neoliberalism, affect, technologies of the self, auto-archeology, attention deficit disorder106 Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies 19(2)  feelings of being undereducated, underresourced, and  undervalued. </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>No one knows all of this, yet it is important that they do.  As an "invisible disability," ADD carries with it lifelong  psychic and social ramifications, affecting the very capacities for individual expression and identity formation (Blum,  2015). As the number of ADD diagnoses increase, and ADD  becomes an increasingly acceptable, even banal, cultural  form, it is important to think critically about this learning  difference and to pose difficult questions: Why, for example, has ADD only recently become such a pervasive cultural phenomenon? Whose desires do ADD diagnoses  actually express, and whose desires are excluded? How  much "choice" and "free-will" does an individual have in  accepting or rejecting an ADD diagnosis? What would people’s lives be like had they never been so diagnosed? As one attempt at engaging with these questions, this  essay (re)presents my own experiences living with ADD as  a child and adult to support a radically historical, contextual, and critical autoethnographic conceptualization of this  learning disability (see Madison, 2011). Specifically, by  building upon Ragan Fox’s (2010) "auto-archeological"  method, a critical perspective that "unite[s] autoethnography and Foucault’s theories of discourse" (p. 140), my aim  is to show how one way of conceptualizing ADD is as a  "technology of the self" that aims at inculcating the everyday "folk sensibility" of neoliberalism (see Mirowski, 2013,  p. 89; see also Brown, 2015; Foucault, 2010). As a "political rationality" that has become increasingly widespread  since the late 1970s, neoliberalism is a paradigm of government that promotes market-based solutions to all social,  political, and economic problems.3 From international trade  agreements emphasizing borderless trade to social policies  emphasizing the privatization of prisons, social security,  and public education, neoliberalism believes that no state or  sovereign entity can solve the world’s problems as efficiently and effectively as the "free market." Yet the effects  of neoliberalism are felt not only at the social scale of the  state and civil society but also at the precognitive and prepersonal scale of affect and the body. Indeed, as Maurizio  Lazzarato (2012), Brian Massumi (2014), and Martjin  Konings (2015) all argue, a defining feature of neoliberalism is its tendency to invest desire with power in ways that  are unconscious, intuitive, embodied, and prior to the  socializing effects of disciplinary institutions (e.g., schools,  prisons, factories, hospitals, barracks, etc.). My conceptualization of ADD as a technology of the self is, thus, an  attempt to emphasize the material substrate between neoliberalism and the everyday performance of subjectivity. As a  "governing apparatus" that guided my incommunicable  childhood desires toward the calculative ends of productivity and efficiency, I will show how, for me, ADD helped  inculcate a neoliberal social imaginary from the bottom up,  encouraging me to freely choose a market-oriented  subjectivity through the modulation of my body’s affect  (Chaput, 2010; Greene, 1998; Swenson, 2013). </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>To communicate this narrative about ADD, I have organized what follows into three sections. In the first section,  I discuss in more detail my methodological perspective,  which builds upon Ragan Fox’s "auto-archeological"  method and makes a theoretical case for reading disciplinary power, technologies of the self, affect, temporality, and  ADD, as nodal points intersecting a more pervasive and  diffuse neoliberal political rationality. The two remaining  sections (re)present periods in my life when the role of  ADD in disciplining my sense of selfhood felt particularly  prominent: my involuntary introduction to ADD, which  began in preschool and culminated with my enrollment at  Thornton Academy in seventh grade, and my voluntary  identification with ADD during college and graduate  school. When (re)presenting the former period, I stay true  to Fox’s auto-archeological method by combining autoethnography with diagnostic material produced by my psychiatrists and interviews I conducted with my parents,  Seymour and Regina Hanan.4 I regard these "sovereign"  institutional and parental voices as central to my own early  account of ADD given how young I was at the age of my  diagnosis and the role they played in my own "discovery"  of ADD. When focusing on the latter period, I reflect critically on the stimulant medications I took and self-help  books I utilized as a graduate student to gain traction over  "my disability." In this primarily autoethnographic section,  I show how the diagnosis that led me to feel separated from  my bodily rhythmicity as a child later became a freely chosen "technology of the self" for grappling with the economic pressures that characterize the contemporary  neoliberal university. I conclude by discussing the importance of neoliberal technologies to materializing ADD as a  public problem as well as the intimate connections between  neoliberalism, ableism, and the contemporary university. </p><p>Auto-Archeology Meets Technologies  of the Self Ragan Fox’s (2010) "Tales of a Fighting Bobcat" is a powerful example of how the power analytics of Michel  Foucault and autoethnography can be brought into conversation with one another. Reflecting on his experience as a  gay student at Cy-Fair High School during the early 1990s,  Fox develops an "auto-archeological" method to demonstrate how "the school’s discursive structures inhibit and  promote different identity positions" (p. 124). He is particularly interested in depicting how Cy-Fair disciplines and  regulates the performance of gay identities. As someone  who endured repeated acts of ridicule, bullying, and humiliation—both inside and outside the classroom walls—Fox  demonstrates, through tales from his own lived experience,  how gay bodies are subjected to uneven treatment based on Hanan 107 their performative deviation from dominant heterosexual  standards and norms. </p><p>At the theoretical and methodological level, Fox’s autoarcheological project hinges on a consideration of how spatial arrangement sutures the discursive performance of  identity and subjectivity. In his account, we learn how the  architectural design of Cy-Fair—from its hallways to its  particular configuration of bodies and objects of knowledge  in the classroom—provide opportunities for some students  to thrive and other students to suffer violence and dehumanization. At the other end of the spectrum, his consideration  of Cy-Fair’s physical layout brings attention to what  Kendall Phillips (2002) terms "spaces of invention."  Through a description and diagram that depicts the way  Cy-Fair restricts the movement of its students, we learn that  Fox moved in relationship to oblique pathways at school  both as a means of survival and as a way to express his  unique lived experiences. </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>By combining the power analytics of Foucault, institutional artifacts from Cy-Fair, and autoethnography, Fox’s  project produces invaluable insights. Too often, Foucault is  interpreted as a systems theorist who emphasizes the topdown effects of power on the "molding of docile bodies." In  Fox’s account, by contrast, we learn about the performative  and psychic dimensions of disciplinary power. Through Fox’s  autoethnographic narratives, which position his lived experiences in relationship to the heteronormative spatial arrangement of Cy-Fair, it becomes clear that disciplinary power  works upon the individual body in a way that is always contingent, material, historical, affective, and discursively unstable. At the same time, because he conceptualizes discipline as  a primarily spatial manifestation of power, his auto-archeological perspective limits our appreciation of the important  role played by temporality in the performative and psychic  enactment of disciplinary power. If, as Foucault (1976/2012)  argues, discipline is a "technology that . . . targets individuals  right down to their bodies . . . [and] behaviors" (p. 9), then it  is important to conceptualize this modality of power not only  in relationship to space and institutional enclosure but also in  terms of the more immediate, vital, and affective logic of  temporality and rhythmicity (see Binkley, 2009). </p><p>One way of accomplishing this task, I argue, is to shift  the focus of auto-archeology away from spatial enclosure  and toward a different disciplinary problematic that  Foucault (1988) terms "technologies of the self." As the  techniques, processes, and rituals that bodies perform on  themselves to gain traction on themselves as autonomous,  self-sufficient, and unique individuals, technologies of the  self facilitate an auto-archeological consideration of power  at the affective register of bodily rhythmicity. In contrast to  a socializing and spatialized conception of power, which  exercises discipline through institutional prohibitions and  juridical constraints, bodies performing technologies of the  self provide a vector for discipline that is immanent to the  pulsations, intensities, and affective flows that comprise the  body prior to its territorialization by symbols and society  (see Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1980/1987). While technologies  of the self always materialize in relation to other technologies—such as those concerning sign systems, economic and  biological (re)production, and political sovereignty—they  are unique in the emphasis they place on the body’s own  unconscious and autopoietic desire(s). </p><p>Technologies of the self is a particularly valuable framework for an auto-archeological perspective that seeks to  appreciate ADD in the context of neoliberalism. Although  Foucault’s (1988) classic examples of technologies of the  self are from the Greco-Roman period and include techniques such the stoic practice of journal writing and the  Christian confessional, it becomes clear in texts such as  Discipline and Punish (Foucault, 1975/1977) and the first  volume of The History of Sexuality (Foucault, 1984/1990)  that technologies of the self multiply and proliferate in modern, liberal society. As an architecture of power that coheres  around the "instrumental rationality" of the capitalist mode  of production (see Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944/1997;  Arendt, 1958/1998; Heidegger, 1954/2013; Marcuse,  1964/2013; Weber, 1905/2013), liberal society requires  technologies of the self for the management and economization of human passions and desires. Through its cultivation  of a secular environment that affectively disavows the promise of eternal afterlife, liberal society has traded in practices  of religious and spiritual asceticism for cultural technologies  of selfhood that generate surplus-enjoyment out of finite  time and temporality (Kordela, 2013; Žižek, 1989). </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>This technological and temporalizing articulation of  reality becomes particularly clear in the secular context  known as neoliberalism. As Foucault argues in the Birth of  Biopolitics, a key aim of neoliberalism is to produce a subject that relates to herself as "human capital." As an affective gaze, or orientation toward society, that seeks to  "entrepreneurialize its endeavors, appreciate its value, and  increase its rating or ranking" (Brown, 2015, p. 36), human  capital speaks to a capitalist epoch where all aspects of  human life—from genetics and marriage to education and  nationality—can be quantified and measured in economic  terms (Greene, 2004). Whereas the Fordist-Keynesian  regime of power that preceded neoliberalism required  "paternal" disciplinary institutions (e.g., the school, the factory, the hospital, the barracks, etc.) to inculcate the instrumental rationality of capitalism, neoliberalism is able to  bypass this logic through the everyday circulation of technologies of the self that (almost) instantaneously temporalize affect and bodily rhythmicity. From the cell phones we  carry (with fertility planning apps such as Choice and navigational apps such as Google Maps—both ultimately aiming to increase the efficiency and predictability of cyclical  movement via the standardization and economization of  time) to the social media websites we visit (which 108 Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies 19(2)  use algorithms to order, sort, and profit from our hobbies,  interests, and passions) to the self-help books we read (to  "make the most" out of our finite time on earth), we reside  in a condition where myriad technologies of the self freely  circulate with the aim of producing an economizing subject  (homo œconomicus) "whose interest is such that it converges spontaneously with the interest of others" (Foucault,  2010, p. 270). </p><p>Based on my lived experiences, ADD is a powerful  example of how this new technological articulation of selfhood can manifest. Despite appearing discursively as a  "learning disability," I conceptualize ADD, from an autoarcheological perspective, as a neoliberal technique of  power that disciplines the body through the management  and modulation of affect. As an example of what Mitchell  Dean (1996) has termed a "reverse salient," I show how my  ADD diagnosis served to inculcate a larger neoliberal social  imaginary from the bottom up by allowing me to economically order and structure aspects of my subjectivity that  deviated from economic order and structure. Through the  affective and mnemotechnical introduction of a "deficit"  that became "the focus of [my] attention and innovation"  (Dean, 1996, p. 57), ADD worked in tandem with a range of  other neoliberal technologies of selfhood (e.g., familial narratives, psychiatric evaluations, stimulant medications, selfhelp books, etc.) to generate a freely chosen market  subjectivity. </p><p>Narratives of Order, Narratives of  Deviation, ADD, and the Chaos of  Correction 12 October 2005 It hurts looking back on all this documentation. </p><p>Seeing my childhood as wrought with malignancy.

I was born in Grand Junction, Colorado, to two of the most  loving parents: Gina and Seymour. Gina, a 4′11″ kindergarten teacher, with short, sandy blonde hair, a petite frame,  and a small ski-sloped nose, had waited her whole life to  have a child. Just like her own mother, Gina’s life revolved  around the distinctly American and middle-class dreams of  her progeny: the vision that her children would achieve  more (economic and social) recognition in their lives than  she herself had achieved. So, after reading countless books  on "effective" parenting, talking to other mothers and  friends about their experiences raising children, and, of  course, teaching kindergarten for the past several years,  Gina felt prepared for her "biblical prodigy," Joshua. </p><p>Seymour, on the contrary, a 5′6″, petite-framed man with  a Mediterranean complexion, mustache, and short, curly  hair, had a different take on childhood. Still a child himself  in many ways, Seymour knew that having a family meant  he would finally have to be settled. Seymour was a very  loving father, a quality evidenced by his wonderful 15-yearold daughter, Jennifer, from a previous marriage.  Nonetheless, when informed of my mother’s pregnancy,  Seymour notoriously asked, "how did that happen!" (S.  Hanan, Personal interview, October 3, 2005). </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>Things were relatively stable during the first few years  of my life, and when I was three, my family and I moved to  Bellevue, Washington, so that my father could take a job at  Boeing. Yet, as my mom notes in one of our first interviews  on the topic of ADD, there was something different about  me from the start: I had always felt like you were a little anxious as a child . . . I  remember showing up one day 20 minutes late to pick you up  from Montessori school, and you were crying hysterically.  This, of course, was not a one-time incident; you often worried  about your family. Still though, it wasn’t until we moved to San  Diego that things became complicated. (G. Hanan, Personal  interview, September 24, 2005) On Things Becoming Complicated In preschool Joshua was identified by his teacher as being  somewhat hyperactive and having limited attention.  (Learning Difference Center, 1991, emphasis added) He had few friends . . . little interest in workbooks, and was  noted to be toe walking. (Wiseman, 1990) We moved to San Diego in 1987, and you started kindergarten  at Jerabek; you also went to the preschool next door, which  was run by that lady Jan Atley. She had a lot of trouble with  you. She was sending me notes all the time telling me how you  were disruptive . . . She said there was a time after class when  they had circle time, and you were constantly bothering other  kids. . . . I always thought I could talk with you . . . [but] Jan  Atley said what you needed was a good spanking. (G. Hanan,  Personal interview, September 24, 2005) There is little I recall of preschool even though I’ve been  driving by that old Victorian building for over 30 years now.  Naturally, Dr. Wiseman and my mother know much more  about my experience there than I do. Letting them speak for  me, therefore, is in a sense speaking for myself. All I have  to ground these early childhood experiences are fragmentary narratives from my family and behavioral diagnoses Hanan 109 from my psychiatrists that, in a sense, have become my own  contested identity. I do not like what Dr. Wiseman says  about me, particularly the connections she draw between  my "toe-walking," hyperactivity, and lack of popularity. Yet  my sense of selfhood is entangled with her narratives, and  the decisions my family made to "develop a plan of attack"  that could "help Josh function better" (Learning Difference  Center, 1991). </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>An Introduction to Discipline: Kindergarten In kindergarten work was sloppy. . . and [he] continued to  be very distractible.

But she  said oh no, if he was gifted he wouldn’t be reading so slow. (G.  Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005) Ms. Evergreen, the kindergarten teacher. Another name  etched into what has come to feel like an increasingly plastic  and amorphous identity. I sense the classroom faintly; the  smell of crayons and a dark stale ambience. Yet, like Dr.  Wiseman, I approach Ms. Evergreen from a detached distance. Who I was at this time in my life seems guided more  by the regimes of selfhood that my family and I were "prescribed" by these various authority figures than any "authentic" inner voice laying hidden behind a secret curtain. As I  listen to this narrative, it, in a sense, becomes part of my lived  experience. How can a kindergartner have an identity anyway? Are these narratives not the very "folding of the exterior" that generated my ADD identity? (Deleuze, 1988, p. 97) The Pill Pusher: First Grade Day care [sic] tantrums, school call-outs, and concentration  problems continued in first grade, resulting in consultation  with Dr. Zoro. (Wiseman, 1990) At Miramar Ranch Elementary [which you transferred to in the  first grade]. . . you actually did pretty well. But you were still  having a little difficulty. . . focusing so we took you to get a  diagnosis for Attention Deficit Disorder [which] is right  around when . . . [the] disorder was kind of coming in vogue.  We saw a psychiatrist named Dr. Zoro, and he had us do a  history on you . . . I told him how there was depression on my  mothers’ side . . . and he thought maybe you had some mild  depression [as well]. He suggested that you take [the antidepressant] Imipramine. And we figured we’d try it. So you  took Imipramine in first grade, and it was kind of a mixed bag.  We weren’t really sure of the results. It seemed like a hit or  miss. (G. Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005) Dr. Zoro—now this is where I start to feel some immediacy. I can remember what he looked like, too, his thin  black beard, penetrating eyes, and angelic white medical  garb. I remember sitting in his office cubicle, taking one  diagnostic test after another. He would show me pictures  with parts of the image missing and ask me to arrange the  images in a particular order that told a story about myself. I  remember how he spoke to me with incredulity and what felt  like a layer of disrespect. Through his "medical gaze," I  recall feeling like a prisoner, some disobedient criminal who  needed to correct and reform his ways (Foucault, 1963/1994).  Well fuck you, Dr. Zoro, and your sterile pills, too! Citizen of the Month: Second Grade This year there have been increasing concerns regarding  poor peer relations, insensitivity and selfishness, lack of  motivation, and progressive aggression and lack of selfcontrol. (Wiseman, 1990) So then came second grade and you started out on the  Imipramine, but . . . it seemed like you were having a hard time  focusing again. And you were doing some really weird things  like irritating other kids, making weird noises, and doing all  sorts of other crazy things at school. So I wasn’t sure if the  Imipramine was making things better or worse at this point. So  we went and saw another psychiatrist named Dr. Wiseman in  second grade and she suggested you try a different kind of  medicine. She said maybe you should try Dexedrine . . . a  stimulant. Then, we also had you tested by the resource  specialist and she found something that might have contributed  to your strange anti-social outbursts . . . she determined you  had a really big deficiency between your verbal ability and  your performance ability. . . . So . . . she worked with you  [also]. (G. Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005) October 3, 2005 As I stand here in front of the closed orange door of Room  221, peering at the entryway of what I believe was my second grade classroom, memories flood my mind. Mrs.  Winters, with her short, curly, orange hair, seemed so kind  to me. She always complimented me and made me feel special. She even gave me a "citizen of the month" award at the  end of the year, a modern sacrament of recognition that my  mom had been waiting for her entire life. Yet, I suspect  these very acts that made me feel "special" actually reinforced my feelings of detachment from my early educational experience. Between the resource specialist, the foul  tasting Dexedrine that I’d leave the classroom to take  throughout the day, the physical exercises Dr. Wiseman routinely asked me to perform, and the overly kind words of  Mrs. Winters, I could feel, in my sinews, that primary education was a space where I did not belong.</p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"> How I long to  repeat this grade over again, and show my mother, Mrs.  Winters, and Dr. Wiseman that I can succeed without the  medications, mechanical techniques, and strategies that  were hoisted upon me.110 Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies 19(2)  Becoming Goofy: Third Grade Currently, Joshua is perceived as a bright child with  excellent reasoning and verbal skills, with difficulties with  impulsivity, inattention, and unpredictability of moods.

So we weren’t sure if it was making  matters better or worse. Then you had fine motor tests done,  and they determined that you had a hard time writing. (G.  Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005) I’m getting to the point now where I feel a little movement and autonomy coming back. The amnesia is slowly  eroding. But all these "crazy," "strange," and "manipulative" behaviors that Dr. Wiseman and my mom talk about  feel like a puzzle to me. I was just being "me," right? I do  recall some of the outbursts I made such as "bazumbah" and  "willie watcha." I think I just enjoyed getting attention from  my funny antics and had a lot of energy I wanted to express.  And truth be told, I just didn’t feel like keeping my mouth  shut. I mean, in all honesty, why should I? To this day, I  have never felt like the classroom should be a place of  restriction and discipline. I always wanted its doors to be  open to "noise" rather than just communication (see Ballif,  1998). </p><p>Repetition and Absence: Fourth Grade, Two  Times Then, in fourth grade we thought we’d put you in a private  school because we thought you’d get more specialized  attention. So you went to the Jewish Academy. Yet instead of  making the situation better, it actually made it worse . . . A lot  of the students there didn’t like you. You were irritating them,  and they wanted to do really good work . . . So then we put you  in this place called the Accelerator Academy for the next six  months, and they didn’t believe in any kind of medication. So I  believe you were off medication at this time. But it still was not  working very well. You were still acting weird. You had  outbursts and didn’t want to cooperate with them. So they  would constantly try to manipulate your behavior, and it  wouldn’t work. So by the end of the year, you were asked to  leave. Then when you went back to Miramar Ranch [the  following year], Ms. White [the principal] said we should put  you in a fourth grade GATE class. She wasn’t sure how much  school you missed, so you repeated the grade. And you actually  did really well in that class . . . I think you were back on  Dexedrine again at that point. (G. Hanan, Personal interview,  September 24, 2005) As Dr. Wiseman’s medical narrative wanes and subsides, my own story comes into focus a bit more. I recall  the fourth grade quite vividly. I remember the Jewish  Academy, where I was attacked and bullied regularly. I  recall being labeled a "moron" and an "ass" simply  because I asked "weird" questions when most of my peers  sat silently and consumed the teacher’s information. I still  have a scar on my arm from Randy, that jerk at the Jewish  Academy who pushed me onto the concrete for being a  "whiner" and a "girly." Oh and then there was the Accelerator Academy. What a  nightmare! I remember the day I was expelled: "Joshua, please read your Worldly Wise passage out loud for  the class." I don’t want to, I’m tired of reading. I don’t understand the  story. Why doesn’t Eric get to go to the zoo? "Joshua, I don’t even want to deal with you today! Get out of  my class, and go back to the Principal’s office where you  belong." [Jumping under the table and hiding] NOOO! I won’t go there  again. You send me there all the time. [Crying.] I hate that  place! All they have me do there is lick envelopes that they use  for marketing purposes! Just leave me alone. . . . </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>The Secret Is Out: Fifth Grade In fifth grade, I believe you continued to be on Dexedrine. You  were in Mr. Kipling’s class, and I don’t think it was as good of  a year for you because the kids were becoming cliquish. And  they were making fun of you because you were acting goofy. I  don’t think they liked you very much. (G. Hanan, Personal  interview, September 24, 2005) You don’t think they liked me very much? You can say  that again. I still remember the tension in that grade like it  was yesterday. I got into my first fight that year and also  went completely unnoticed by my first childhood crush.  This was the first time I think I really wanted to fit in; to  feel the frictionless travel and movement around the  school that my fellow classmates seemed to be experiencing (Fox, 2010). Yet I remember feeling very rejected and  marginalized. God it was painful. And that FUCKING  medication, which I can still faintly taste in the back of my  throat. I would leave class every day at 1 p.m. so I could  go down to the nurse’s office and take my second dose of  stimulants. It felt like everyone knew what was going on;  that they all knew I was the "ADD child."Hanan 111 The Last Straw: Sixth Grade Then, sixth grade was a disaster. That’s when you went to  Eastside [Middle School] and again you were acting really  goofy, and the kids once again didn’t like you. And if you’re  asking me what I mean by goofy, I’m not sure what that means,  but you weren’t a very serious, focused student. You would  make outbursts, and the kids didn’t really like you. So by the  end of the semester, I filed a grievance with the school district  because I didn’t feel like your needs were being met. And, I won  the grievance, and then you went to Thornton for two years.  (G. Hanan, Personal interview, September 24, 2005) Looking back, sixth grade truly does seem like one of the  most negative years in my life. I still remember Gregory  calling me a "faggot" in the locker-room and whipping me  with a towel. I also remember being physically assaulted on  the playground by Melissa, one of the most attractive and  popular girls in my class. I wonder whether things could  have been different. It is hard to say whether all the therapy,  pills, and special treatment I received from my teachers  made my experience better or worse. As my dad notes about  my sixth grade teacher: And then there’s that stupid thing that lady [teacher] said when  you were in sixth grade. She tells the whole class you have to  be sensitive to Joshua. . .he has ADD, and you have to realize  he’s a misfit or something like that. She didn’t use that word,  but that’s what she implied by that. You had this thing where  you didn’t fit into this category. And most of the kids didn’t like  you . . . I really felt like you were rejected by a lot of friends and  family growing up. (S. Hanan, Personal interview, October 3,  2005) A Natural Attraction: ADD Meets the  Discipline of Rhetoric As I reflect upon the narratives surrounding my childhood  diagnosis of ADD, it is difficult to make sense out of the  experience. Certainly, there are emotions that linger with  me up to the present. But what is most startling to me, as I  revisit the voices of my mother and father, as well as the  various psychiatric documents used to (over)determine my  ADD diagnosis, is the absence of my own voice. I vividly  remember as a child moving through various institutional  spaces—from classroom, to the psychiatrist’s office, to  family dinner table—but what sticks out most is a certain  temporality, an affective pulsation of fear, unease, and  uncertainty that something was not right with me. I recall a  desire to resist, to reject the regimes of selfhood that felt  foisted upon my body. But I also recall, over time, settling  into my ADD diagnosis—not necessarily as a way to  "improve" or "correct" my behavior, but as a way of concluding that the normal pathways of society were not for  me. As teenager, for example, I found identification through  non-normative activities. I became a vegan, anarchist  "crust" punk and involved myself with unconventional  activist groups such a Food Not Bombs and Earth First!.  Rather than try to become accepted by the "popular"  crowds, who had continually rejected me since kindergarten, I came to embrace cultures and experiences that stood  on the fringes of society. </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>What stands out as particularly troubling and difficult to  reconcile in the present, however, is the stark contrast  between how I reacted to my ADD diagnosis as an adolescent, and how I came to freely embrace the "learning disability" as an adult. What felt like an incomprehensible  punishment and imposition that I sought to resist as a child  and teenager became, in my adult years, a vehicle for selfempowerment and self-expression. This shift in perspective  seems particularly vivid around the time I transitioned to  college. Unlike elementary school, which disciplined my  body for thinking and acting against the norm, college felt  open to a variety of cognitive dispositions and worldviews. In fact, in some of my humanities classes, thinking  critically and participating in activism seemed to even be  encouraged. </p><p>Nowhere did this sentiment become clearer than during  my third undergraduate year at Humboldt State University.  I was enrolled in a required major class called "Introduction  to Rhetorical Theory," and I was expecting to have minimal  interest in the topic. Yet, after only a few class sessions, I  became intrigued by the subject matter. Part of this enthusiasm, I can still recall, stemmed from the way "the subject of  rhetoric" aligned with my subjectivity as an ADD-diagnosed  child and teen. Rhetoric gave me the vocabulary to think  critically about my early encounters with my diagnosis,  turning this ostensibly genetic "neurochemical imbalance"  into a technē of power, persuasion, and coercion. Whatever  the particular details of the alignment were, by the semester’s end I knew I wanted to further study and ultimately  teach rhetoric. The "weird," "goofy," "crazy," and "strange"  child who "didn’t fit into a category" now had a queer and  disabled language of his own called "rhetorical theory" (see  Dolmage, 2016). </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>By the time I began working on my master’s degree in  rhetoric at San Diego State University, however, I quickly  learned that a life dedicated to the study of persuasion and  power was not immune from its own institutionalized manifestations of power and persuasion. In addition to instilling  in me an insecurity that my troubled educational experience  as a child and teenager put me at an intellectual disadvantage relative to my peers (who, at least on the surface,  seemed to have chosen an academic career partly because  of their previously successful educational experiences),  pursuing a Master of Arts in Communication Studies taught  me that, to secure a job as a professional rhetorician, I  would have to publish my ideas in "peer-reviewed" journals. As a technology aimed at the production and dissemination of "expert" knowledge, publishing in journals felt 112 Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies 19(2)  terrifying to me given that they appeared, in many ways, as  concerned with "measurement" and "assessment" as the  diagnostic tests I was forced to take as a child—both at  school and in the psychiatrist’s office.5 My anxieties around academia became even further  intensified when I began working on my Doctorate in  Rhetoric and Language Studies at the University of Texas. I  had a passion for studying rhetoric, that much was certain,  but, as one professor said to me over Facebook (in an act  that reminded of the institutionally sanctioned elitism and  bullying that I endured during middle school), my "cards  were stacked really low." Hence, in what can only be  described as a painful and ironic twist, it was upon working  through cruel affects of failure and insecurity during my  Doctorate program in rhetoric that I decided to get re-diagnosed with ADD. Realizing that, without a network of selfhelp resources, I would be vulnerable to the "market  discipline" of securing a tenure-track job, I began voluntarily meeting with a psychiatrist and seeking out ways I  could become a more "productive" and "efficient" graduate  student. I was confirmed during my first psychiatric visit as  having "Adult ADD" and was immediately prescribed  Adderall, a stimulant medication similar to the Dexedrine I  had previously taken as a child. Initially, the drug provided  a powerful boost to my focus and productivity. Whereas my  childhood experimentations with similar medications are  clouded by memories of peer judgment, a bitter taste in my  throat, a racing heart, and the inability to fall asleep at night,  during graduate school, I felt the Adderall was an "edge"  that could help me economically compensate for my lack of  education as a child and teenager. As a medication (molecularly similar to cocaine and methamphetamine) that produced feelings of concentration and euphoria, Adderall  acted as a pharmacological "technology of the self" that  buttressed and supported the "technology of the self" that  was ADD. Through its capacity to help me bypass the usual  feelings of fear, dread, and doubt surrounding academia,  Adderall not only assisted me in working more efficiently  but for longer and more prolonged periods of time. Who  needed rest, relaxation, or even sleep when I could take  Adderall and work like a well-neurochemically-lubricatedmachine all the time! My enthusiasm for Adderall, however, soon waned.  Whereas initially, a 10-mg dose supplied clarity, confidence, and focus throughout the day, my tolerance increased  exponentially after several months. A 10-mg dose was now  required simply to sustain my previous "base-level." I also  found myself increasingly detached from social surroundings as I became interested exclusively in work and productivity. With the neurochemical bathing in dopamine that the  Adderall provided, my world materialized through a lens of  cost-benefit analysis. Any deviation from graduate studies  and the pursuit of publications was a waste of valuable time,  and if I did take time off to go to a concert or go on a date,  they needed to provide the biggest possible "bang for my  buck." Under the influence of Adderall, my sense of temporality radically shifted. I transitioned from someone who  valued a range of work and non-work activities into someone who valued productivity and efficiency "around the  clock." Realizing that this legally endorsed activity seemed  unhealthy for my long-term psyche and mental health, I  read books on ADD to learn about the pros and cons of  long-term stimulant use. Most of the books were proponents of medication use, and virtually all of the books communicated that long-term usage of Adderall was "safe" and  "normal." Consider the following endorsement of stimulant  medication found in one the first books on ADD that I read  as an adult: From a medical standpoint taking [stimulant medication for  ADD]. . .is not a difficult decision.</p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"> Stimulant medications, the  main group of medications we prescribe to treat ADD, are as  safe as penicillin or aspirin when they are used properly. First  used in 1937, they have been around for more than 60 years, so  we have extensive research data on them and decades of  clinical experience. (Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 2005, p. 241) Safe, so they say, but in what sense? While it is one thing  to be safe from the impartial standpoint of a "medical  gaze" (Foucault, 1963/1994, p. 9), it is quite another to be  safe in a way that respects the "singular rhythms" of my  body (Muckelbauer, 2009, p. 33). While I cannot speak  for others, in my experience, taking stimulants as an adult  was anything but "safe." Although it reinforced a view  popular since Francis Bacon’s day (i.e., that science can  be used as a form of power to extract excess energy and  value from nature and the body), stimulant medications  left me feeling physically and emotionally depleted. At  the time, however, I was unable to value the voice of my  body over the voice of experts. Thus, when it came time  to either quit Adderall or request an increased dosage, I  chose the latter. </p><p>In addition to reinforcing my decision to remain on stimulants, in spite of the increasingly toxic affect that they cultivated, these popular books on ADD provided me with  "self-help" strategies to assist me in being a more successful graduate student. While some strategies were indeed  helpful, I found that, as with the medications, they also led  me to feel increasingly robotic, mechanical, and economizing. These self-help strategies essentially indicated that if I  wanted to make my "life go smoother and easier . . . [I  needed to] identify a problem, something that makes our  lives more difficult and less productive, . . .[and] come up  with a strategy to help" (Puryear, 2012, p. 15). The irony  was that in identifying these "problems" aimed at making  my "life go smoother and easier," I had created an economy  for aspects of my life that were formerly off-limits to Hanan 113 market discipline. Thus, if taking Adderall was not enough  motivation to work like a machine "day in and day out," the  self-help strategies ensured that any remaining "downtime"  would best be used in "preparation" for success during my  marathon working days. The temporality that, as a child, led  me to despise authority figures and want to avoid the classroom at all costs was now infusing my body with a new  internalized (and paternalizing) authority figure who sought  to formulate "everything, everywhere, in terms of capital  investment and appreciation" (Brown, 2015, p. 176). </p><p>As shameful as it feels to admit, and as difficult as it is to  commit these words to paper, I maintained this masochistic  regimen for the remainder of graduate school, throughout  my 2-year appointment as a non-tenure-track assistant professor at Temple University, and well into my current tenure-track position at the University of Denver. Eventually,  as the ups and downs of Adderall-fueled-workaholism took  an increasing toll on my physical and mental health, I concluded that I must give up my investment in being a rhetoric  professor in order continue professing rhetoric. Since my  first "introduction to rhetorical theory," my desire was to  teach and research rhetoric no matter what the "cost." But  the paradox was that to study "the art of persuasion" I had  unconsciously persuaded myself that productivity was all  that mattered. </p><p>For over 4 years now, I have been free of Adderall and,  interestingly, feel more in touch with my voice as a rhetoric  scholar than at any time during my ADD regimen. I still  likely work far more than I should. And I still subtly crave  the feelings of focus and euphoria that initially came with  taking Adderall. But I know I can never go back. I know  now that neither the institutional sanction the drug enjoys  nor the psychiatric voices that spectrally haunt my own adolescence and adulthood know what is best for me and my  body’s singular rhythms. </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">\n                     <voice name="en-GB-OliviaNeural">\n                         <prosody rate="0%" pitch="0%"><p><p>Conclusion: On Neoliberal  Detachment This essay has explored my involuntary and voluntary identification with ADD as child and adult. Using a revised version of Ragan Fox’s auto-archeological method, I have  shown that one way to conceptualize ADD is as a technology of the self that aims at inculcating the everyday folk  sensibilities of neoliberalism. Through a consideration of  how my own affect and bodily rhythmicity fueled my early  and late diagnoses with ADD, I have shown that the disciplinary power exercised by this "learning disability" can be  conceptualized less in terms of spatial enclosure and more  in terms of the everyday imperative to economize time.  While institutional enclosure (such as the psychiatric and  educational spaces that I moved through as a child and  adult) undoubtedly played an important role in my encounter with ADD, what seems exceptional about the diagnosis  was the way it took on a life of its own by wounding, and  then economizing, my body’s unconscious and prepersonal  affects and desires (Brown, 1993). </p><p>As a consequence of these insights, I draw two conclusions. First, there is the distinct possibility that "learning  disabilities," such as ADD and ADHD, are co-constituted  by the matrix of practical reasoning that makes the disability "measurable" as a public problem (Greene, 1998, p. 31).  While I do not presume to speak for others struggling with  ADD and ADHD—many of whom I’m sure benefit significantly from diagnosis and medication—this essay shows  that, in the case of my own lived experiences, AD(H)D is  entangled with a neoliberal social imaginary that governs  bodies through the vital management of affective energies  (Chaput, 2010; Swenson, 2013). Whereas previous manifestations of capitalism required paternal disciplinary institutions to inculcate the instrumental rationality of capitalism  (a reality first illustrated by Marx [1867/1990] more than  150 years ago), neoliberalism is a political rationality that  seeks to immanently harness the energy, dynamism, and  vitality of life itself (Foucault, 2010, 1976/2012; Rose,  2009). As my own narrative about ADD shows, the affective imperative to economize life was an encounter that  began prior to my entryway into preschool and organically  evolved into a technology of selfhood that lives on in me  today as an associate professor of rhetoric at the University  of Denver. In a world where the "invisible" pressures and  forces of the self-regulating market have become the quintessential expression of discipline, AD(H)D diagnoses strike  me as an ideal way to produce imminently governable neoliberal subjects who perceive themselves to be autonomous  from any particular historical context or apparatus of power. </p><p>The second conclusion to be drawn relates to the oftenoverlooked relationship between neoliberalism, ableism,  and the critical humanities. If my localized experience is at  all indicative of how other academics with learning differences feel, the critical humanities have failed in creating an  inclusive academic space for what Silberman (2015) calls  "non-neurotypical" bodies. While the performances of gender, sexuality, class, and race are rightfully receiving  increased attention in the critical humanities (see, for example, Calafell, 2012), we should be equally reflexive about  the implicit and explicit ways these disciplines perform  ableism (Dolmage, 2017). Writing for and getting articles  published in academic journals is not a feat that comes with  equal ease to everyone, and yet, in today’s neoliberal academy, it has never been more central to "measuring" one’s  academic size, virility, and prowess (Gunn, 2008, pp.  85-86). This economizing of critical humanistic scholarship  is not only symbolic (and regularly exploited as a form of  "cultural capital") but also material. As an integral component of neoliberalism, the critical humanities participate in  the competitive ordering and sorting of scarce resources  (Chaput, 2008; Harney &amp; Moten, 2013). They determine 114 Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies 19(2)  who earns "secure" tenure-track positions and who remain  laboring precariously as instructors and adjuncts. They  decide who shall tell their stories and who shall not. They  inadvertently encourage some of us to consume stimulant  medications, and others to simply break down, in the never  ending pursuit of "doing what we love" (Tokumitsu, 2014). </p></prosody></voice></speak>', '<speak><p><p>The critical humanities needs to be more reflexive about  their perpetuation of ableism as well as their participation in  neoliberalism’s political economy of knowledge. Neoliberalism  is not an ideological superstructure that scholars can transcend  through the cultivation of reason and a thriving public sphere.  Nor is it a cold and austere market logic they can comfortably  critique from the sidelines. Neoliberalism is warm to the touch.  It is embodied through the air that we all breathe. It is an everyday folk sensibility that must be combated at an equally affective, corporeal, and immanent level if we are to resist its  poison. </p><p>Declaration of Conflicting Interests The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with  respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this  article. </p><p>Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research,  authorship, and/or publication of this article. </p><p>Notes 1.
